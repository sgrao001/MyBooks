## Pursuit of Ignorance

Being able to reach a point of “I don’t know” is important. It begs the question, do I want to know? Why? What will I do once I know? 

My pursuit of ignorance says a lot about me. The recognition of ignorance shows my wisdom. The acceptance of ignorance shows my humility. The ignorance I pursue shows my interest. How I use the knowledge shows my plan.  What I accomplish shows my strength. As I start over, I show my perseverance. 

My ignorance tells me more about myself than my knowledge ever will.
