## An Enchanting Journey
![[ThreeElementsWassilyKandinsky1925.jpeg  ]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">An Enchanting Journey</span></p>
There is something revealing about viewing large things in three parts, each part equals the other, and the observer becoming integral to the observed. 
The infinite can be transformed into less intimidating, even navigate-able explorations. 

Earth-fire-water; a necessity for life. Man-woman-child; the essential unit of family. Yesterday-today-tomorrow; the stuff of history, poetry and dreams. 

In our attempt to appreciate the vastness of nature, its immeasurably awe inspiring presence, the never ending interplay of its manifestations and the state of constant adaptations, we might undertake three journeys - the journey into the self, the journey into our worldly existence, and the journey into the vast unknowns beyond our current life and the known world.

## Awareness
![[Awareness.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Awareness</span></p>
I lie on the floor, on my left side, my head on my arm. I drive a red matchbox Citroen with springy wheels and a removable roof canoe. I hum the engine noise to myself - I hear the engine - I shift gears - I drive with precision around imaginary curves and turns - I keep humming - I park with precision in my imaginary spot - My humming keeps my attention fixed on my driving my Citroen across the balcony floor. The outside world fades and time stands still. 

I become one with my being and my imagination.

<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
## Unity
![[Wall.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Unity</span></p>
I sit sideways on an orange couch, back to wall, arm placed comfortably on the back. I look past the metal accordion gate. I notice the randomly shaped - somewhat oval - light colored - moss patch on the compound wall - I notice the snails on that wall - I empathize that the rain drops flooded their underground home. I shift attention to the brick oval landscaping on the ground. I see the rain droplets fall into puddles in the oval. I watch the rings expand - see them bump into another ring - merge into it - and then again - and again - I follow the rings as they blend into each other - I can’t see the rings anymore - I feel the unity 
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
## Silence
![[Rope.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Silence</span></p>
I sit sideways on an orange couch, back to wall, arm placed comfortably on the back. I look closely at the metal accordion gate. I notice the skipping rope hanging on the latch. I push the grip and watch the rope swing. I watch the swing reduce - and reduce - then slowly, begin to move in ever so small circles - now, I can now barely see it move - I watch the still, silent, unmoving rope - I feel the silence and the quiet within myself. 

Silence filters the noise around me. I hear my thoughts. My thoughts are the voice of my soul. I dialog with my thoughts. We both listen. 

Silence preserves my energy. I open up to new patterns, to new motivations. I recognize emotions for what they are. I become an observer, not an actor on my own stage. 

Silence allows me to be with myself. I don’t have to accept. I don’t have to simplify or explain. I don’t have to partition myself. I don’t have to project. I am in agreement. I can remain close to my awareness of being. I can explore. 

Silence grants me distance, it gives me clarity. I can develop a frame of reference that works for me. It gives me freedom to be authentic, fearless and purposeful.

My treasure is buried deep. It is the silence and a solo journey that will take me there.  

Silence respects time and grants me personal growth. 

Silence between the question and the answer is where “I” might be found.

## Serenity
![[Serenity.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Serenity</span></p>

I walk up and sit a few paces away. My energy rings wafted his way. I see him tense up. He begins rocking sideways on his feet. I sit still. I drift toward my inner silence. The outer influences drift away. The water begins to look hazy and blends with the sky. The noises reduce to a low hum. My energy rings begin to dissipate. He senses the withdrawal - relaxes - and goes back to his own inner space. We sit in silence. We sit in harmony. We sit in unity

## Who am I
![[AdiShankara-WhoAmI-800BCe.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Who am I</span></p>

Advaita Vedānta tradition.  
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
"I am other than name, form and action.  <br>
My nature is ever free!  <br>
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.  <br>
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual."</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

## Words
![[Words.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Words</span></p>

At the Houston Japanese garden - each flower speaks to me. I hear the bouquet say - “I let go of my grievances!!! I see beings - smiling, supporting and encouraging. Beings who are pure and pristine.  Beings who have shed their wrongs through penance and punishment. I am unable to walk towards my light. I too am cleansing myself of my burdens. It will get easier. “

## Acknowledgment
![[Acknowledgement.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Acknowledgment</span></p>
I saw him cross in front of me. 

He stopped. He sat still. He was barely visible. He was one with nature. I watched him closely. His eyes moved. He observed me. 

He appeared relaxed, trusting, comfortable, confident. I belong to a different species. Likely, he wanted nothing from me. Likely, he was just acknowledging of me, as I was of him.  

We both stood motionless. In peace. 

I captured this moment of silent mutual awareness. He was being generous with his presence. Does he know me from somewhere? I feel a closeness. 

We moved on, to our different ways. I wonder where he will sleep tonight. Be well and thank you, Mr. Rabbit.

## Vastness
![[Vastness.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Vastness</span></p>

They say, I will see farther, perched upon the shoulders of those before me. I see the parts they gave to me, of which I am made. I see the thread that connects me to them and them to me. I sense their acknowledgement as I share these moments with them. In looking outward, I see the vastness inside of me. I see I am not alone. I belong.

## Man and boy
![[Man&boy-EmilyFelcher2025.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Man and Boy</span></p>

The man busies himself, burying his fears and polishing his victories. Recognition is his just reward and adulation is his honor due. 

The boy seeks love and acceptance, to understand that which childhood brings forth. After much wait, he finds it, buried inside him, gifts from distant people, from distant times. Freedom becomes his reward. After much delay, he teaches himself to pass it forward. He finds a purpose for his treasure. 

The boy is luckier than the man. He is able to make time his friend.

## Wheels of Life
![[WheelOfLife.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Wheels of Life</span></p>

It took a while for life to come into focus. I see me, rolling my wheels along many roads and alongside many travelers.

I push the wheels with sticks that I find by the wayside. I am proud of the sticks I find. Especially, the ones that are straight, strong and light. I spend time  sorting through sticks, Some are heavy and bent and some brake easily.  I notice people pushing wheels with all kinds of twigs and pieces of bark. I continue looking for sticks. 

I look back to see my wheels moving along on their own. They are beckoning me to join. I don’t need sticks after all. I get behind my wheels. My wheels and I, we move along in harmony.

## Be well my friend
![[FriendshipPicasso1908.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Be Well my Friend</span></p>

My life long best friend and protector needs my help. He has asked little for his steadfast dedication. I have not been a good ally. I have been distracted. 

I am there for him now, in deep gratitude. I align my mind and my soul, and share soothing conversations of rest, respect and love. We have so much to cherish.
Together, we have been recipients of great treasures and blessings. 

People journeying to great unknowns, to find us their best gifts, so we may come to be. They reach out, offering us strength and resolve to take our journey to where it leads. 

There is much promise on the other side,  the promise of unity. There is also sadness, of parting ways one day. Like a rocket ship falling back to earth, he will see me off. I will feel great sadness as I look back fondly on times we had, things we made our own, and things we left behind. I will feel great joy as I realize that true treasure is that which we have gifted, some by design and some without. It has created a bond, an everlasting purpose. 

That is the promise of what we will leave behind.

## Footsteps
![[LookingBack-EmilyFelcher2025.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Footsteps</span></p>

Truth was often late coming to me, she got delayed crossing the bridge of believability. 

My relationships with my many avatars of awareness, acknowledgement, understanding, acceptance, submission and release uncovered the true offerings of life and nature. 

Going inwards before going outwards made my strength visible. They let me pass without a battle. 

Shame has been the root of my pain.  Guilt lives in the house of prolonged blame. Guilt is the root of my self-doubt. My ego created greed and together they became the root of my conflicts. Letting them point out the bad’s and the good’s was at the root of my mistakes. I tried to give my thoughts, more attention than their words. Failing in that, was the root of my regrets. 

My obligation has been an outcome of mis-directed responsibility, the former kept me trapped while the latter set me free. The real measure of my happiness has been the reduction of suffering in myself. My inheritance from people who survived over a few million years should have been sufficient for me to thrive for a few decades. My survival was never at stake, the freedom to reach my own realizations has always been. Silence has been my safe place. Silence has been my treasure.

Self interest is ubiquitous, self discipline is not. The irony about discipline is that once you have it, you don’t need it.  Being a non-conformist was natural. There was much to observe when alone. Sometimes there was more to be gained, but there was always more to be lost. I accept my losses. Discovery buried in the details gave me a sense of accomplishment. People who have hurt me come to mind so much easier than people who have helped me. I have not done well with gratitude. 

Kids deserve a chance to shape their contributions. My attempts to keep them free from fears, illusions and  promises were partially successful.

## In Crossing
![[GeorgeInness-TheLastGlow1885.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">In Crossing</span></p>

I venture to the edge, toward the light, in anticipation, in uncertainty, unsure of reasons, but sure of intent. Away from the shadows, away from safety. New beginnings, new pathways, new experiences. Rejoicing in the freedom, in the silence and in the light. 

I embrace the sense of achievement, for a past well-lived, gratitude for the treasures found, fondness for the memories left, hope for the work incomplete, promise for the desires unfulfilled, comfort for the beings in the woods, encouragement for the dreams carried, love for my fellow journeying souls,  respect for the togetherness offered, nostalgia for times spent. Peace for all. 

We shall meet again.

## CityVerse
![[ClydeSinger-RushHour1937.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">CityVerse</span></p>

A place that binds people and experiences together - to co-exist, to support and to flourish. A place of majestic structures, roads, and dreams.  A place where communities share discoveries,  joys and sorrows. A place of inspiration to create new stories and  share old ones.

A place where countless experiences are beckoning from around every corner.
A place that reveals the strength, in the struggles and successes, of times gone by. A place where every brick on every wall, tells of a design and a purpose for its being, placed there by a man, as an expression of his creativity and toil. 

A place that provides camaraderie, and easy ways to get lost in a crowd. A place where the freedom to dream allows the  welcome of the unexpected. 

A place where streams of energy emanate from every cobblestone. A place that gladly offers this energy to energize the body and the soul. 

A place that is a kaleidoscope of movement. A place where every block shares a different promise and every street points to a different path. 

A place that has become an essential part of my being. A place that creates a whole that is vastly greater than the sum of its parts and makes it available for all to partake.  

There is a permanence to a city, a steadfast presence. There is continuity amidst change. There is strength in the diversity. There is promise in the uncertainty. There is peace in the chaos. 

I find new offerings every day. I am grateful for it.

## Duniya
![[EdwardMunch-Vampire1895.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Duniya</span></p>

Love envelopes nature. It nurtures bonds of togetherness and extolls virtues of harmony. It builds communities of peace. 

Power, shrouds itself in righteousness, grasps at strength and demands obedience to offer a pretense of peace.  

One destroys, the other creates. One hurts, the other heals. One gains fame, the other remains anonymous. One fears, the other suffers. 

Cycles of suffering and pain continue amidst love and hope. Cycles of fame and fortune continue amidst deceit and downfall. History’s lessons remain  unread between the pages of time.

## Lessons

## Stones, Wind and Water
![[Stones.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Stones, Wind and Water</span></p>

Oh! How the mighty mountains have been ravaged by wind, water and time into pieces of stone scattered on the ground. 

As time passed, the stones transformed themselves into pyramids, minarets and stupas, attempting to recapture the majesty, the power and the purpose of the mountains they came from. 

Why did the stones on top forget that the higher they go, the harder they fall? Why did the stones on top forget, that growing bigger only makes the wind push harder? Why did the stones at the bottom not recognize the increased burden? Why did the stones at the bottom not see their purpose diminished?

Why did they not seize the opportunity to be stable on the ground, to be next to each other, to be away from the wind, to be able to gather around and hold water for plants, and flowers and birds? Why did they not see themselves as stepping stones, leading a path in support of the glories in nature? Why did they not realize that this was their destiny?

## Manufacturing Conflict
![[Wars.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Manufacturing Conflict</span></p>

Wars waged on, egged by the egos of lords, masquerading as ideology. 

No matter who wins, both are diminished. The lords will profit more if they collude to establish collective dominion over the serfs. But their egos goaded them to war. 

The disproportional distribution of wealth, ensures that the winning serfs will get little or none of the spoils of war. The losing serfs and their families will suffer pain, dishonor, years of servitude and abject poverty. Serfs will risk their lives and a great many will loose it. 

Blacksmith’s on both sides will profit, selling arrows, swords, spears and shields. Neighboring lords will smell blood in the water and join in, taking all they can. 

Ego demands serf blood, and gets it. Ideology makes serfs act against their own self interest. Blows traded spawn never ending cycles of violence. War morphs from a choice made by the lords, to a necessity for the serfs. The lords nurse their bruised egos back to glory. 

The lords are always the winners. History remembers them. The serfs have no names.

## Ideologies & Realities
![[Ideology-NaziProps.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Ideologies & Realities</span></p>

“A heroic leader on a white horse rallies the troops, while the wounded valiantly struggle to get on their feet to resume the fight.” , “ with illusions of honor”, “knowingly welcoming death. ”

Ideology is the primordial state of augmented reality serving to simplify it to willing listeners. Ideology insists, on the one hand, that its depiction of the underlying reality, albeit in its simplest form, is accurate, and on the other hand, its association with that reality is sacrosanct. 

Ideology purports to enhance the value of reality by making it accessible, understandable and acceptable. It reduces the multitude of properties of reality, into a single dominant characteristic, to deliver a concrete shape that can be received  through simple abbreviations of thought. It reduces reality to a probability. It trains the mind to constrain reality, and claims this as necessary, for understanding to occur. 

This “subligation” from reality, becomes our natural state. It becomes the core of our progressive learning. It permits us to congratulate ourselves on our intelligence, our righteousness or any other attribute we wish to be identified with. We can now safely ignore what is “abrogated” from reality. 

This partition of the “subligated” and “abrogated” is not absolute. It does not need to be. Participation can occur as an observer of reality, not an explainer of it.  

The whole picture emerges, when I seek “descriptive adequacy”, not “explanatory clarity”. Ideology takes my freedom away. 

Ideology positions itself to be more important than reality. Illusion becomes reality and reality is relegated to the realm of an “imagined” state. But, without reality there is no ideology. 

Ideologies grouped together become rituals. Ideology grants an implied meaning to rituals indicating that somehow rituals have an impact on reality. 

Winning an argument becomes a certainty if is preceded by a pivot from reality to ideology. Since reality has many detractors, it is the easiest pivot. 

Filtering attributes of reality to project it on an already accepted ideology, masks the underlying harsh, impoliteness of truth.

In a contest with ideologies, reality loses the battle every time . It is the win of reason over knowledge. 

Ideology explains that which we want to be true.  In its most harmful state,  ideology rationalizes our desire to act against our own interests. The truth reveals itself only when the tinted glasses of ideology are removed. This realization occurs after most of the damage is done. 

We “buy organic sugar” because we believe that we engage in healthy pursuits. We “associate wealth with our self worth” because it is natural, not because it is a fetish. We “reward monopolies” because we believe they must be doing it better than everyone else.  We “consume” because we believe we deserve it. We “tolerate”, because we believe things could be far worse.  We “fight” because we believe we are on the side of the just. We “kill” because they “would do worse to us” or “in the name of what’s right” or as in it’s latest form, “to stop violence”, “to bring peace”. and on and on and on …

We are pre-disposed to adopting ideologies as explanations to uncomfortable truths. A gentle nudge completes the journey.  Once an association is established between any reality and any accepted ideology, the reality, no matter how grotesque it is,  inherits the qualities that the ideology purports to project. 

Ideology gently cleanses our view of the undesirable state until truth is no longer necessary. It makes irrelevant all that is unsaid. It blurs the lies. It deflects responsibility. It negates our role in reality. It enables the death of hope. It  constrains us inside acceptable frames of reference. 

We feel good. We don’t realize we are the “boiling frog.” We make freedom and self-expression the causality.  We accept that this as the best that is possible. We believe, “It really can’t be that bad”, “it will only get better”, “we, must therefore make the best of it”, “what better choice do we have”. 

Time tested structures in society, from the humble family unit, to corporations, to governments and religions, effectively use ideologies to favor the few and suppress the many. 

Are we satisfied with descriptive adequacy or do we seek explanatory understanding? Do we rely on evidence gathered in due course of time, or do we draw conclusions based on reasoning? Do we understand how our biases define our acceptances? Do we have the freedom to dis-associate ideology from reality without fear of punishment?
Should we accept simplicity and universality of love, harmony and well-being as the only ideology worth fighting for?

History tells us stories of ideology. Time will reveal the stories of reality.

## Time
![[DamielHeller-Time.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Time</span></p>

Time as we understand it, is a powerful measure, highlighted by the universality of its acceptance and the simplicity of its function. It has half a dimension. It does not regress. It is consistent, accurate and perpetual. It is available without need to expend effort. It is ubiquitous.  It creates no awareness of its presence. It has no enemies. We think of time like a meter running in the background. 

The cognitive revolution in man started with an understanding of tense - past and future.  It gave man, memory, anticipation and urgency. 

Understanding came from evaluating outcomes that occurred in the past. Hope came from plans and actions, to direct outcomes in the future.  Happiness and sadness came from occurrences in the past. Excitement and fear stem from anticipations of the future. Illusions of confidence, came from plans and action’s perceived ability to control future outcomes. 

Value comes from favorable outcomes accumulating over time.  Time gave us a basis for measuring value. Achieved value depreciates in time. Value is rarely persistent. 

Man discovered a purpose in life - “the desire to preserve or grow value over time”.  Gain of value represented security. Its potential loss became a threat. The desire to hoard value formed the basis of greed.  Greed became essential for the “new” survival. Greed was “good”. 

History is an account of two dimensions, time and the transfer of value amongst men. The velocity of transfer has been proportional to the of brutality in the occurrence. 

Man evolved from the pursuit of food, sex and shelter, to seeking value, fearing the loss of it, and acting in ever creative ways to secure as much of it as possible for himself. 

This new found pursuit became the root of all good and all evil that mankind brought upon himself and on nature. 
The “hoarders of value” learnt to collaborate to grow. They learnt to deceive and to usurp another’s value. They learnt to adapt to new threats. They extinguished all species, whose behavior did not direct value to them. They  “domesticated” all else. They eliminated men, sparing only those willing to submit their value to them. 

Humble men who were once secure in the knowledge that three hours of hunting and gathering, each day, was sufficient to sustain life,  became insecure in a 24 hour pursuit of value for someone else. 

Humanity may pivot to re-claiming time for peace, harmony and well-being. We may choose to focus on the awareness of our being and that of others and make time our friend. We may re-orient understanding and hope and put it to work for our collective well-being. 

Maybe, we will.

## Space, Time and Energy
![[Space-Time-Energy.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Space, Time<br>and Energy</span></p>
I alter the paradigm I use to define my relationship with time. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">I think of time, not as a background ticker against which all things progress, but rather as a meter that reports a change of state in items that I choose to place into my basket. </p>

With this paradigm, time, like space, becomes a dimension. I can change the rate at which time flows, just as I change the rate at which the space in my basket fills up - by altering what and in what order,  I add / remove items from my basket. 

If absolutely nothing in my basket changes, no items vibrate, no energy shifts, no events change, nothing happens, then time does not exist. Time imposes no cost on me. 

Time, space and energy emitted are intrinsic properties of the items I place in my basket. I can quantify the value of each item by these properties.  I cannot control how much space or time an item occupies, or the energy it releases, at any given moment. 

Items in my basket continually move from a steady state, I.e a state constrained by my choices, to one of instability, as dictated by each items inherent reaction to random probable events.  It is in each items nature to continually alter its properties of time, space and the energy it releases. I can only control what I allow into my basket.

Therefore, I am left with one of two  choices. Do I toss the item from my basket, or not? and, Do I react to a change in its state, or not? I must cleanse my basket frequently. I can easily run out of space and time in my basket. I must remove items and residual debris they leave behind.

I cleanse my basket by zooming into and panning around each item, with the express intent of constructing a new context, within which, this item has no relevance. Once that happens, the item longer exists in my basket. 

I continue this process of cleansing until I am left with one item, - my breath. Breathing is the minimum essential item that I must leave in my basket. I begin to sense the stillness of my mind between breaths. In this state of singularity, I become intensely aware of my being. Time does not exist except for this one item. In this state of singularity, I am clean, empty and open. 

If I am able to revert to my singular state of being, at any given time, then I know I am tossing out unstable items from my basket, as they are created. I am keeping pace with myself. I have order and items of quality in my basket. 

As I cleanse my basket, I selectively add items from the outside universe, into my basket. Time now begins to track the internal change of my breathing event, and the unique ever changing state of each added item. I choose items that promote passionate living and harmonious co-existence with the universe outside. These items take up the least amount of space and time in my basket and release the most energy to me. With this construct, I find meaning and energy in my life’s choices. 

The order in which I insert items into my basket is dependent on energy they release for my use. I transition to a consistent,  sustainable and a self-directed state of self-value. 

Time is no longer a measure of the messiness in the universe, but rather a measure of the order I have created for myself. 

I think of my basket as a structure that is dynamic and made of “dimensional
units” called space, time and energy. Space is analogous to the energy I consume to maintain each item in my basket. Time is analogous to the energy I consume to measure and react to changes in the item. The size of my basket is the sum total of the energies received from the items, less the energies required to maintain and react to changes in it. This defines my capability. Passionate and harmonious living grows my capability. Growth becomes my choice. 

This definition of time establishes my relationship with reality. I can now define my reality as a function of the items in my basket.  This insulates me from the inherent turbulence of the reality outside. 

Time is no longer a measure of duration, it becomes a measure of change, and as such, it is far more useful to me. It removes my recency bias and allows me to focus only on the cause-effect relationships within my perceived reality. Time, like space, becomes a dimension, which creates a definable co-relation between it and my current state. Time is no longer a container of everything. Time itself is contained within my basket. I am therefore not limited by time. I am limited by the energy surplus in my basket. With frequent cleansing, I cannot be overwhelmed - I will never run out of time. Time, like space, is no longer a constant. It is constantly impacted by the items in my basket. It is a measure of the structure within my basket, as it is in the moment. Items outside my basket, are outside my field of view. I focus on what is to be done now without the distraction of probabilities or possibilities imposed on me from outside my basket. I understand simultaneity of change. I become the preserver of order in my basket. I realize that time and space interchangeable and are just labels for the energy in my basket. 

This does not changing anything that I am intuitively programmed to do. It is just illuminates why I do it and how I can make it more meaningful and sustainable. 

I hope to practice reaching a singular state ,multiple times each day. It is my place of rest and validation.

## Gratitude
![[AlbrechtDurer-PrayingHands1507.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Gratitude</span></p>

I have so much … so much, to be grateful for. I forget that sometimes. I get busy with my pursuits. I get pre-occupied with the joys of gifts received.  

Happiness is a gift that is short lived.  Efforts to reduce pain, without joy to fill the void, is an uphill battle. 

If there ever was a switch that can turn  “on” happiness, I believe It is gratitude. 

When gratitude is expressed, the grantor gets to recognize their effort as a success and be acknowledged for it. That opens the door to good feelings. 

When gratitude is expressed, the receiver gets to enjoy the benefit of the gift and the knowledge that the grantor has been rewarded with expressed appreciation. 

Gratitude accompanied by mutual respect, with no expectation of profit or recurrence on the part of the receiver, and an acceptable effort on the part of the grantor, grants favor to both. 

The process of receiving a gift is the best motivator for paying it back to someone else in some other form. It pushes the wheels of life forward. It nurtures a community. 

Feeling grateful for a gift received, or being thankful to be able to give one, is an instant “on” for good feelings and positivity.

People ask me what I plan to do when I retire. i am hard pressed to find a better use for my time. 

There are people and things I am grateful for. Some of them are far away in my past. I will keep looking for opportunities,  to pay and to receive as I go forward.

## Energy
![[Energy.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Energy - Food for the Soul</span></p>

I sense that all things radiate energy. 

The non-living do so in quantities that are largely fixed in intensity and form - a stone might offer its energy as a result of where it is found, or it might present a particular color. It is largely static. It changes form only when acted upon by an external source of energy. 

Mountainsides and caves are formed by flowing water - or - are made into beautiful sculptures by the skilled hands of man - or - chunks of carbon provide heat when burned - or - are pressed into diamonds over time. 

Unlike stones, living beings continuously make decisions on what energy they absorb, how they interpret it, how they transform it, how much they radiate out, in what form and to whom.  They find purpose in employing this energy to make things of “matter”, to the benefit of all. 

Humans, as compared to other living creatures, have evolved to the pinnacle of this capability. 

The energy sources that we can tap into is limitless. What we do with it, however is limited by our awareness of its presence and its power to transform our imagination. 

We all start out as unconscious consumers of energy, and employ it without much thought or purpose. We rely on our primordial instinct to direct its use. 

Over time we come to realize the nature and value of this gift. We realize that it gives us the means to transform our very existence to one of ease, grace and meaning. We realize that that we have the responsibility to use it for the benefit of all. 

Our respect for this offering shapes the essence of our life’s journey. The entire universe becomes a gift, a reservoir of beauty and promise, to be nurtured, adopted and eventually handed back.

## Acceptance
![[ShahAlamConveyingGrantOfDiwanitoLordClive-BenjaminWest1765.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Acceptance</span></p>

Robert Clive of The British East India Company, a public corporation, accepted the Grant of the Diwani from Shah 'Alam, in 1765, effectively netting tax returns each year from three Indian provinces, Bihar, Bengal and Orissa, of a sum exceeding the GDP of UK at the time. 

Acceptance of a win incurs a responsibility and commitment that defines the final outcome from the win. 

Acceptance of a defeat has no relevance to the unfolding situation, nor is it of any consequence to the people impacted. The winner defines the relevance and consequence. It may however, give the vanquished a few additional choices on how he conditions his personal response to the defeat. 

No win or loss is lasting. Like shifting sands, moving across, no acceptance is permanent. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">I accept my wins. I accept my losses. <br><br>
I accept my acceptances. </p>

## Choices
![[TheChoiceofHercules-VirtueandPleasure-BenjaminWest-1764.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Choices</span></p>

I have choices. I hear opinions. 

Do I see the pitfalls? What do I consider, what do I discard?  Do I act now or wait? Do I choose a sinful path, or a virtuous one?. Do I pick ascent or descent? Do I push through to victory, do I retreat? Do I prioritize me or them? Do I know right from wrong? 

All actions are an act of choice. 

All will be judged based on the time and effort consumed to release residual energies in all participants. The final verdict becomes available only after all the healing and cleansing is done. 

Until then, there are choices and there are opinions.

## The Good, The Bad
![[RepraisalsFromUprisingOf1857.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">The Good, <br>The Bad</span></p>

We seek good. Good welcomes. It opens its doors.  Some come to be part of the good, and some come to profit from it. Good shares its fortunes, the bad eagerly takes it. 

The two take sides, like a child’s see-saw, sometimes one is up, sometimes the other. 

The bad doesn’t have to play by the rules. It has an edge. It works persistently to exploit the advantage . Eventually the bad triumphs. But in their triumph they have destroyed the good - they have killed the goose that laid the golden egg. 

The bad cannot survive without the good. They have nothing to feed on. They have to leave. If they stay they will feed on each other. They must leave,  before they empty the place of all life. But, they know they will be back, when the good has painstakingly rebuilt itself from the rubble. 

So they leave. They leave behind despair and ruin. They leave behind numb pain. The bad have no desire to share in the pain. Ironically, it makes them feel “bad”.  So, they leave. 

 On their way out, they bad feel compelled to justify their actions, even paint them in a good light. It makes them feel “good”. Even the bad want to feel good. They excuse the bad by pointing to the “good they have done”.  They blame the good “for not seeing it”. They say the bad had to be done for the sake of the good. They say it’s self defense. They are victims too. If only the good hadn’t resisted so much. They even say they are sorry to have done it.

THE BAD - In 1857, the British rode in to observe their win, "The orders went out to shoot every soul," recorded Edward Vibart, a newly-orphaned 19-year-old subaltern. "It was literally murder.... I have seen many bloody and awful sights lately but such a one as I witnessed yesterday I pray I never see again. The women were all spared but their screams, on seeing their husbands and sons butchered, were most painful.... Heaven knows I feel no pity, but when some old grey bearded man is brought and shot before your very eyes, hard must be that man's heart I think who can look on with indifference....". Though the royal family had surrendered peacefully, most of the emperor's sixteen sons were tried and hung, while three were shot in cold blood, having first freely given up their arms, then been told to strip naked: "In 24 hours I disposed of the principal members of the house of Timur the Tartar," Captain William Hodson wrote to his sister the following day. "I am not cruel, but I confess I did enjoy the opportunity of ridding the earth of these wretches."

THE GOOD - Along a dark, dingy back passage of the fort, Russell was led to the cell of a frail 83-year-old man who was accused by the British of being one of the masterminds of the Great Rising, or Mutiny, of 1857, the most serious armed act of resistance to Western imperialism ever to be mounted anywhere in the world. "He was a dim, wandering-eyed, dreamy old man with a feeble hanging nether lip and toothless gums," wrote a surprised Russell. "Not a word came from his lips; in silence he sat day and night with his eyes cast on the ground, and as though utterly oblivious of the conditions in which he was placed.... His eyes had the dull, filmy look of very old age.... Some heard him quoting verses of his own composition, writing poetry on a wall with a burned stick." For all the tragedy of his life, he was able to see that the world continued to turn, and that however much the dogs might bark, the great caravan of life continues to move on. He wrote in a poem, shortly after his imprisonment, and as Mughal Delhi lay in ruins around him:

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Delhi was once a paradise,  <br>
Where Love held sway and reigned;  <br>
But its charm lies ravished now  <br>
And only ruins remain.<br>
<br>
No tears were shed <br>
when shroudless they  <br>
Were laid in common graves;  <br>
No prayers were read for the noble dead,  <br>
Unmarked remain their graves<br>
But things cannot remain, O Zafar,  <br>
Thus, for who can tell?  <br>
Through God's great mercy and the Prophet  <br>
All may yet be well.
</p>

It is accurate to say that the Mughals did exactly this to the good residents of Delhi a few generations ago. The good then was in such plentitude that it may have transformed the then bad. 

Occasionally that seems to happens too. Could it be that Gaza is going through this ordeal now?

## Writing
![[WritingGeorgeLin.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Writing</span></p>

Creativity thrives along the path from the knowledge core, to the edges of cognitive capacity. It is guided by pre-dispositions inherent to me. 

As I write my words, I receive the learning that the writing process offers to me. I learn to give meaning to my innermost thoughts, to polish them to a bright shine and to lay them out for all to see. Most of all, I experience an awareness of who I am. 

When I read my own words, I get to bring my thoughts, experiences and my emotions back to life. I re-live the sights, the sounds, the smells to find new meaning in them. I get to understand where the words came from. I get to re-visit why I put them there. 

I think of writing as an expanded form of painting. It allows me to add the nuances of thought. In my mind, a thoughts start with an image. Words allow me to explore my thoughts. 

I would like to think that the readers of my words will get to explore their thoughts in a different light.

## Let’s make a circle 
![[Manipulate.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Let’s make a Circle</span></p>

I say “hello”, to acknowledge their entry into my conscious space. They smile and begin painting a picture. 

I see their image floating into place at the center of the picture. I recognize the implication -  they represent the truth. They start placing artifacts of value around them, scattered about in a circle. They present the artifacts as reflections of their truth, as outcomes of their rightful behavior. 

 The artifacts seem slightly out of focus. I say nothing. They notice my willingness to accept the scene, imperfect as it is. 
 
 They extoll their noble intentions and proclaim their struggles in building and maintaining these collections of artifacts. They describe the injustice the world mets out to them for their positions around the truth. I empathize with their struggle. 

They continue to add more artifacts in ever expanding circles, each outer circle of artifacts gets blurrier than the one inside it. I am to believe that the artifacts are clear reflections of their central truth. But I see that the connections are getting more tenuous as I look outward. They sense  skepticism. 

They offer to clarify and enlighten me. They invite me to add my artifacts to their circles. They say the  invitation is an expression of their love for me and my best interests. I add a few of my high value artifacts, to their scene. 

I am now committed to their story. The imperfections in their scene now become mine. The blurriness of every artifact becomes a reflection of my weakness, and not their adaptation of truth. My own truth is split up and delegated to the periphery. Soon my choice becomes binary - defend their imperfections or explain my inadequacies of understanding or worse - my deceit. My truth which was so simple and clear is now barely visible, shrouded in a hazy, blurry mist. I am unable to speak my truth.  I have made my truth subservient to theirs. I begin to doubt my truth. I am no longer interested in my truth. 

Dissidence on my part, is a confirmation of my intent to cause them harm. Disconnection makes me a bad person and invites scorn, while staying in the circle makes me a fool and invites disrespect. 

The best I can do now, is walk. Cut my losses and leave. I need the last draws of my courage to make my own path forward. I need support from people who offer it with love. 

They have gained mastery in maneuvering artifacts around to attract people into their circle. People who will toil hard for their cause. They know they will eventually loose them, most will burn out, the rest will walk away.  They will have to keep cultivating conquests. There will never be enough. More will be needed soon. 

They express surprise and shock, as they see me leave. But their pain doesn’t last long. They get busy keeping their current conquests on life support. There is still more harvesting that is being planned. 

They get busy looking for their next conquest. 

Carl Sagan’s quote from The Demon-Haunted World, reinforces the futility of the status quo,
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">“Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”</p>
I add my own words to Carl’s,
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">“if you do get any of your power back, it will be corrupted enough, to where you will likely become a perpetrator of that which victimized you”.</p>

So, I must leave. The air is clear and fresh. My path is my own. I resolve to stay away from people in circle's.

## Diwali  
![[Diwali.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Diwali - A Festival of lights</span></p>

My passion, my understanding and my perseverance, fuel my flame to illuminate the path, upon which I continue my journey of life. 

The light from my flame, guides me around pitfalls and sharp curves in the road, exposing meaningfulness and creativity around each corner. I motivate myself to push forward. 

The light from my flame shows me other people moving along the path. My light joins up with theirs. Soon things begin to appear brighter and clearer. The colors seem crisper and shapes are better formed. Destinations, yet undiscovered, begin to appear on horizons. I no longer feel the need to reach beyond my grasp. There appears to be a big world up close and all around me. 

The light from my flame has uncovered  a camaraderie between people that I have never known. We begin to share our finds. Together we learn. I realize the healing that comes from the bonds of common purpose. The tiredness melts away. 

I find that the journey provides more than the destination ever could. I realize, that it matters not where you go, but, who you go there with. Meaning shared, is no longer a pursuit. It is the matter of being. The journey is and always was the destination. This find, I could not have found, were I alone and by myself. 

I never imagined that one flame could transform the world into a bright, sparkling festival of lights.

## Just Asking
![[JustAsking.jpeg]]<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Just Asking</span></p>

Was a dollop of passion dropped on me and am I now purposed with the pursuit of knowledge and excellence in the exercise of that passion?

Am I to spend this life in fearful praise of the divine, and patient anticipation of a glorious afterlife, that my self pronounced faith professes will be mine?

Am I to immerse myself in efforts, bringing value to others, or finding cures to ailments, because I am told, that it is the right thing to do?

Am I to receive small pleasures, like shells scattered on the beach, as my reward for each day? 

Am I to skim the surface of life seeking nothing, finding nothing, but being content nonetheless?

Am I to think of life as a game of chance and accept, whatever comes my way? 

If the rewards of pursuit result in continuity of living, is the hunt worth the effort? Should I care? Doesn't life continue on its own, until its eventual end?

Will the pursuit of journey into the self reward me with the meaning of life? Does the self exist solely to provide me with a meaning? OR does the meaning exist because the self does?

Are relationships formed to appreciate collective meaning? Is meaning of my existence served by the existence of others? What is my contribution to the collective meaning?

Does life have a meaning? When I die does the meaning no longer exist? Is the collective meaning diminished by my death?

Am I a perturbation in contributing variables, as evolution takes its minute steps? Am I at the end of a branch in evolution, or am I at the start of a new one? Most likely, I am in the middle,  irrelevant to the direction of evolution.  

Since meaning is an attribute of awareness and understanding, is the meaning of my life whatever I want it to be at any given moment in time? 

Are descriptors like happiness, suffering, love, compassion, respect, awe,  expressions of the meaning I attribute to my life? 

Is the meaning I attribute to my life more important than the meaning others attribute to theirs? Is this distinction the source of pride, joy, greed, division, love and hate in me? 

Does my ego require my life to have meaning? If I were to proclaim a meaning to my life, what does that alter in me? 

Who assigns meaning to divinity? Why is mankind not able to reach consensus on what that is?

As Richard Feynman said, “I would rather have questions that can be answered, rather than answers that can’t be questioned. There’s no shame in not knowing everything, it’s in not wanting to.”

My ignorance knows no bounds. I look forward to the pursuit of my ignorance for a long time.

## Fragility
![[Fragility.jpeg]]<br><p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Fragility</span></p>

The ultimate greed for power mandates the need to mask the fragility of the human experience, by the erection of grandiose thoughts and structures, imagining that this will transpose a weakened self, into the divine, thereby projecting a permanence of the imagined state. Notwithstanding, that lasting power comes from contributions made to the living condition of all beings, through love, humility, patience and not from larger than life displays. 

The attempt at grandiosity in itself, exposes the nonexistence of power within  the imagined self and lays bare the illusion contained within “the divinity of beings”.

## In God we Trust
![[InGodWeTrust.jpeg]]<br><p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">In God we Trust</span></p>

Science continues to encroach on territory formerly titled to God. Carl Sagan was once asked, “Given this demotion, is there a God to you? Is there a purpose, given that we are sitting on a spec in a sea of stars?”

Carl, with his characteristic curiosity, asks, “I do not want to duck any questions and I am not going to duck this one, but let me ask - what do you mean when you use the word ‘God’?”

The question is clarified, “Given all these demotions, the notion of God seems to slip away, where does that leave us?”

Carl replies, “On our own! This to my mind is much more responsible than hoping that someone will save us from ourselves, so we don’t have to make our best efforts to do it ourselves. If we are wrong, then that’s ok. We’ve hedged our bets. Its Pascal’’s bargain run backwards. 

The word God covers an enormous range of different ideas, running from an outsized light skinned male, sitting on a throne in the sky, telling of the fall of every sparrow, for which there is no evidence, to the God that Einstein or Spinoza talks about, which is the sum total of laws of the universe. It cannot be denied that the universe follows laws, and if that’s what you want to call God, then of course God exists. There are numerous nuances; for example, there is the ‘Diest God’ that many of the founding fathers of our country believed in - a sort of do nothing king. A God who creates the universe and then retires.

If I say a god exists, or if I say he doesn’t, you have learned absolutely nothing. So, why we use a label so ambiguous, that means so many different things to so many people; because, it is a generic enough label, that you hope will give you the freedom to seem to agree with people with whom you fundamentally do not agree. It covers over differences. It makes for social lubrication. It is not an aid to truth. We need much sharper language and honesty to seek common understanding. ”

As described by Carl, it could be that a diest God created the universe, or as science hypothesizes, the universe started off through a series of morphogenic adaptations continuing to this day, originating from an accidental single cell life form, and evolving as a response to a series of chance stimuli’s, to give me what I have and be born into this world. So, here I am.  

Praying to God for what he did not give to me in the first instance, would be a nonsensical burden on him and utterly pointless.

Begging forgiveness or offering repentance is worse as my transgressions are not against him, but against fellow beings on this earth. It would be morally reprehensible for me to wrong one and then ask forgiveness from another. 

At the time of making of the universe, no promises were likely made for my afterlife or the route I would have take to get there. I have this life to make the most of. Asking about an unknown, yet to come incarnation, which was not his task at hand, when he made me, makes even less sense. 

I also hope God has not planned my life to every minute detail, as that would absolve me of all responsibility and equally importantly of all of its joy.  Also, most messes in my life are uniquely mine. 

Of course, all this is negated if I believe that God made me as a specific individual with all my accompanying attributes, and did the same for every other being that ever lived, in all time. 

It is certainly a comforting thought, that God would go to all this trouble for me. I would have to imagine that he created all the stages of my genetic evolution to make one of me. I wish he would tell me the purpose for my existence. It would take the guesswork and chaos out for me. 

If we can be sure of one thing, it is that nature and life is governed by the laws of chance. This may be by divine design, so that every living being has a fair shot at living. It ensures that the game of living cannot be rigged to favor a few. Only the most adaptable beings have survived. Chance by definition, cannot be planned. It
may seem that science has given us a temporary edge by tilting the field in our favor. But that will likely change in time. 

As I get older, I am progressively less able to defend myself against chance occurrences. Virus and bacterial attacks, weakening organs, lower mental acuity, all signs of running out of my birth gifts. 

I often find solace in the belief that I have an ally - GOD - and the faith, that he has sent me off with the means to find acceptance and peace within myself, both as I stand now, and as I will, before the light finally turns off. 

I may object to actions of the body and the mind, but, am unable find blame with the 'soul'. 

There is a rationalization that goes as such,
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Souls impart life to the being. The soul never dies.  They are eternal and part of one whole. They remain connected to each other In life, and on release, they merge up with other souls into a welcoming infinite being. I can call this infinite being God. </p>

This argument provides me with a sense of custodianship of all life in all beings. It forms the basis for empathy, compassion and unity. It provides for continuity, belonging and it opens up a pathway to rise above the fray of my current states and find acceptance and inner peace, within my reach. 

I will need a lot of practice at this.
