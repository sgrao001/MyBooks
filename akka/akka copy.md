## ‘Akka’ - A quiet hero  
![[]]<font color="#f09e5a">’Akka’ - A quiet hero</font>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">The fever came on fast. My grandfather, a man of purpose and authority, returned home from Nanjangud with a heat in his bones that wouldn’t break. Akka only 43, watched as her world began to crumble, once again. This wasn’t just a man dying; it was their livelihood, their children’s future and her own dignity slipping away hour by agonizing hour. <br><br>The decisions that my grandmother took, as she raised her fledgling family, would resonate three generations down. </p>

When I met Akka in Bangalore as a young adult, I saw a petite, frail, elderly woman, laying on her bed in a large, bare room. She had lost most of her sight. I saw her listen to the news on a small transistor radio by her bedside. She felt the warmth of the morning sunlight that came in from window on the far side of the room. 

When I got to know her, I felt no sadness for her frailty, only respect and pride for someone, who had experienced living, by overcoming great odds, with courage and integrity. She had developed a consistency of thought amidst tragic changes. She had learnt to take fear in her stride. In her presence, I sensed an alertness. Her quiet confidence was subtle but visible. There was always a tone of encouragement  in her words.   

‘Akka’, everybody I knew called her that. It means ‘older sister’. They used it as a term of endearment, but also one of respect. Akka, was my father’s mother, my grandmother.

Growing up, I didn't know Akka very well, but in writing about her now, I hope to understand her a little better. There is much I have learnt from knowing about her life. This is my way of paying her my respects. 

I am also writing this for my sons. Akka passed away before they were born. I want them to recognize some of her strength, grace, and compassion reflected in their own lives. 

They say, ”you see further, standing on the shoulders of those before you”. This is a my way of handing my sons a piece of their legacy, that I received from Akka. 

For anyone else who reads this, I hope it offers a small glimpse into the daily life of one family in a small Indian town in the early 1900s.

In today's world of "in your face" progress, and "I deserve my wants" bravado, Akka’s journey helps me separate the grain from the chaff. Her life taught me that the fight for survival, even against all odds, can be won with honesty, dignity, and compassion. Akka lived her life by the clichés we often use today, to mask the occurrence of the opposite.

## The World She Was Born Into
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a">The World She Was Born Into</font>

Akka was born in 1901 in Hassan. There is no official record of her birth. She was most likely born in her maternal grandmother's home. 

Hassan is a small town in Karnataka, in the southern part of India. It is an ancient town. Even today, it has a well aged look of ancient glory. You can see that glory reflected in the eyes of everyday people in Hassan. The name 'Hassan' comes from'Simhasanapura', ‘the city with the throne of the lion’. People believe their town was ruled by the great grandson of Mahabharata’s mythical hero, Arjun. At the time of Akka’s birth, Hassan was part of the princely state of Mysore, under British colonial rule. 

Life during Akka’s youth was built around agriculture and civic administration. Akka called her father ‘Doddanna’. Doddanna had found employment at the Maharaja’s palace. A stable employment at the palace, was a welcome relief for her family. Doddanna was able to avoid some of the economic hardships of the time. He was able to protect his ancestral land from hardships and moneylenders. This gave Akka a better start in life than others in her family.  

Akka’s extended family lived close by as marriages were often arranged amongst “like” neighbors. Her security and support came from cooperation within these strict familial hierarchies. 

Akka’s parents didn’t move about much. The little land they had kept them anchored to their community. Other than marriages or visits to places of worship, there weren’t many reasons to justify the expense and risk of travel. 

In Akka's time caste was a powerful component of life. How her family practiced their faith, what they ate, who they associated with, the kind of jobs they held, who they married and where they lived was dictated by caste and the family elders. This provided her with safety, in her early years.  

 As her life’s story unfolded, Akka was forced to give up the safety of established norms. Norms, that she had been taught to live by. The narrative of ‘fate ordained’ was used as a constant reminder that ‘this was the best it could be for her’. Akka was able to break free of these narratives and chart her own path forward. Her choices forked new branches in the road, upon which I was able to travel with much ease. 

Akka lost her place in her society when she became a widow. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">The two traditions I find most distressful in her times time were, <br><br>
The first one was regarding marriages - A girl had her husband selected when she was between 8 and 10, a mere child. Although she weren't technically married, her future was tied to her selected groom for all practical purposes. If he were to pass away, and this happened more often than I can contemplate in today's society, she would be condemned to a life of widowhood.<br><br>
The second one was the prescribed life of a widow - widows were not allowed to remarry. She was required to shave her head, and wear a white cotton saree, colored by soaking it in turmeric and kumkum. She could not wear a blouse and was to only eat one meal a day.<br><br>
Widows were considered a bad omen. Association with her was considered to bring upon bad luck. Her presence was considered inauspicious at religious and other family celebrations.<br><br>
Akka's life and choices was to be severely impacted by both these events.</p>

As was the case with most cultures around the world, in her time, gender equality considerations were largely nonexistent. While Akka was immediately cast to the bottom of her social hierarchy, by a misfortune, that was no fault of hers, life for her father was very different. Her father remarried after the requisite wait time, and life returned to normalcy for him. I have even heard it said,” Remarriage for a man was a noble act, because it represented his concern for his children who would need a mother.” His only constraint was - marry within the caste and do not marry a widow. The contradictions and the hypocrisy exhibited by these norms did not escape Akka. 

Akka’s life was a precarious balance even without this misfortune. Nutrition was scarce. Many women and children died in childbirth. Illness and disease took its toll on people.  Average life expectancy was between 25 and 35 years. 45-55 years would be considered a full life for an adult. Living started early, and did not last long. There was no time to prepare for adulthood. There was no time for childhood.
## Childhood and Early Loss

![[DODDANNA2.jpeg]] 
<font color="#f09e5a">Background</font>

It was into this environment that Akka was born. 

As a child, Hassan would have been Akka’s whole world. The mud walls of her house, the cow sheds nearby, the smell of spices being ground in the kitchen, the creaking of bullock carts as they passed by, the street vendors selling produce that they had picked from nearby fields early that morning and brought them into town to be sold in time for the afternoon lunch - would have been familiar and a comforting part of her world.  The nearby temple bells at the crack of dawn would be her wake up call. 

I remember her telling me that as a kid, she would play with dolls made of clay. Her mother would stitch clothes dolls. Most games were simple make-believe games she played with siblings and kids in her immediate surroundings. 

Akka’s family belonged to the Brahmin caste, which placed her in a privileged position for education and employment. 

Within the Brahmin caste, Akka’s family belonged to the “Deshashtha” sub-sect. “Deshastha Brahmins” were followers of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, which taught the principle of duality—that the individual soul 'atman' is distinct from God 'Brahman'. People from her caste were prominent members in society, focused on priesthood, administration, and scholarly roles.  Doddanna was a beneficiary of this societal structure.

Akka spoke “Marathi” and “Kannada” at home. Her parents settled in the region of India known as "Bombay-Karnataka region". Her marathi had a pronouced accent, much different than what I heard growing up in Bombay,

Akka’s life was deeply influenced by the customs and beliefs around her, which she later translated, not into rigid dogma, but into a fearless sense of right and wrong. 

Her father, Mahapathi Srinivas Rao - Doddanna was a forest officer for the state of Mysore. He was a man of above average means. He name “Doddanna” was a respectful name for a man of stature. Doddanna left a powerful impression on Akka, riding off on horseback to survey the forests, a man of authority and purpose.

Akka was a light skinned child with green eyes. Her given name was “Narsubai”. 

I recall Akka telling me her early childhood, the first seven years of her life, was fairly typical, even comfortable for her time. She was the first child of her parents and she had their full attention. Akka did not speak much about her mother. She did not get to know her. Akka was born when her mother was 20 years old. 

But, Akka’s life was marked by early tragedy. Her mother passed away when Akka was only seven.  Death was a commonplace occurrence in Akka’s times. Akka once told me that she had heard of women in neighboring homes succumbing to illness or childbirth, but she had never experienced it up close until then. Her mother’s passing was sudden. Relatives and neighbors were present at the 2-week long ceremony that is customary in a Brahmin household during such occasions. People expressed their condolences to Doddanna, and most expressed sadness at how the next phase of Akka's life would be very difficult without a mother. Close family consoledher and offered her assurances that everything will be alright. When they left there would be silence in the home. Akka sensed tin her father's voice, his concern for her her welfare.

This was a scary time for Akka. Her father loved and cared for her, but he would never be close to her like her mom. Akka had to come to terms with loosing her mother, upon whom she had been so entirely dependent for her own physical and emotional existence. I can imagine Akka, silent and alone as a child, not knowing or understanding what was to come next. Her mother’s passing placed her in a new world of fear and uncertainty.

The other implication of this tragedy, although she wasn't aware of it then, was that her childhood days would soon be over. She would have to "settle down" into a marriage, so she wouldn't be a 'responsibility' to anyone.

Akka's aunt, Doddanna's sister, 'Jeevathay' had been married as a child, and her promised husband had passed away when she was just ten. She had to begin her life as a widow. Since she had no kids of her own, it was decided that she would take care of Akka.

This was Akka first exposure to widowhood. As Jeevathay’s life and challenges unfolded, Akka saw first hand, the inescapable long term implications of the loss of a husband. It was to be a glimpse into her own future. I believe this shamefully unjust legacy of Indian culture, which still has some remnant echoes today, shaped Akka’s early views on life and injustice. Though she accepted the realities of her time for herself, she never instilled these beliefs in her children. 

Tragedy brought on tremendous feelings of uncertainty and fear in their young lives. Akka and Jeevathay, began a life of mutual dependency and support. They grew close to each other. 

Doddanna, who was often away at work, provided for his sister and daughter’s well-being.  Akka took pride in saying that her father travelled to his work on horse back. Doddanna must have left a strong impression on her young mind, as a man of stature and authority, sitting up high up on a horse, to go out and survey the forests. I have a note from Ratna, Akka’s daughter, who writes of Akka remembering this time. Akka says, “I was raised like a princess.”

Doddanna arranged Akka’s marriage when she was eight years old. My grandfather was nineteen. His name was Yedatore Srinivas Rao. Akka, having completed the third grade, was required to quit school once her marriage was fixed. 

Akka did not know your husband.  She would be emotionally and financially dependent on strangers in his family. She would have children. Childbirth might cost her or your children their lives. 

Living in today's world, I find it unbelievable that a third-grade child would be expected to contemplate marriage. Akka was consoled that this would be the best for her. It would provide long term stability and security. Akka was still processing the pain and loneliness of loosing her mother a year earlier. Now, she would have to come to terms with being cast out soon, to face a new uncertain world that would be immensely personal and over which she would have little or no influence. Akka entered into this phase driven by a sense of duty and obedience to the customs of her time. As with everything in her young life so far, her thoughts on her own future would not be taken into consideration. She was just a child after all. This was one society’s unexplainable and vastly unjust contradictions. 

Rationalization, if I can call it that,  came to Akka in the form of the following words, “The consequences of not marrying in time is worse.” “You will find a new life in a new home.”  “They will provide you a safe and stable future”. There are so many compelling reasons why this might not be so. But I suppose, if Doddanna were to pass away, then it would be good for Akka to have her husbands family to lean on. I am sure this was expressed in no uncertain terms as well. 

I am unable to comprehend how Akka dealt with all this uncertainty, fear and anxiety that she faced. She wasn’t the only one, Jeevathay likely went through the same. They might have even talked about it. Not, that it would matter. 

In my attempt to understand the path confronting Akka's childhood. I have rationalized to myself as this being a choice of survival. The uncertainty surrounding financial resources and health, both yours and that of your immediate family, requires you to skip childhood and move into adulthood as soon as possible.

The other perspective in this unfolding situation is the role of the adults. Did they promote these choices as the least of other evils, with genuine concern for Akka welfare? There was an expectation from society, that elders in the family would actively take their children down this path. If they did not, they would be scorned upon for not shouldering their responsibility.  Adult men and women had differing perspectives and compulsions in this process. Men considered this as their responsibility and a source of pride, while women thought of this as their obligation to support.

Subsequently I got to know Akka, as a strong and independent minded woman, despite her being refused most opportunities that we take for granted. I believe that she parted ways with this belief system in her own life. Akka's first two her daughters were married in this traditional format, but my father and his sisters forged their own path forward, with choices they made that they saw to be in their own best interest.  

At 13, Akka left to begin her new life in Mysore. Mysore is roughly 80 miles south east of Hassan. It is an all day train journey. A formal wedding ceremony was planned to see Akka off. Her father made all the arrangements. A dowry of land, a little money and other minor essentials were given to Akka’s new family. Akka understood that her husbands family were doing her a favor by accepting her into their family. She was to remain grateful to them.  Her father sent a cow and a cowherd with her, to ensure that she would be provided for. Akka once told me that the festivities made her hope that her transition into married life would play out well. 

It helped that her husband, my grandfather, himself in his late teens, was a good young man. I am not aware of my grandfathers perspectives in thiss regard. Ratna, Akka’s daughter writes, “My father was a very affectionate man.  He took good care of Akka. “

 I believe that Akka's own journey through the fearful and conformist phase, to a self reliant and even rebellious phase was her decision of choice. I am not aware of the reasons that prompted this shift. The courage and conviction that she would have to summon to change direction, in a largely conformist society, would have been inspirational to understand. My memory of Akka, which stems form a much later point in her life, leads me to believe that she took the reins of her and her children future in her own hands and decided to forge a new path. She made a decision that her kids, who were still home, would do better. She was going to figure out how, and make it happen. It speaks to Akka's ability to take the decision, and once she took it, her ability to persevere down this new path against all odds. Looking back, the results are obvious to me. My father and his two younger sisters placed themselves on a path of independence and growth, while my father's two older sisters required an additional generation before their kids could get the same point.

I believe my father was the biggest beneficiary of the change Akka made. She made it Ok for him to go down this path, shielded him from scorn, and being a man, society was more lenient in its acceptance of his right to do so.

## Life as a Young Wife and Mother
![[Akka-Youth.jpg]]
<font color="#f09e5a">Life as a Young Wife and Mother</font>

Akka did not have the time to learn the skills she would need as she started a new life in Mysore. She would have to figure that out along the way. If she was lucky, she would find encouragement in her new home. 

Akka knew that life would always be a moment away from tragedy. She would need to have reserves of strength, should that situation come to be. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Akka once told me that life was “the story of the tousle between your fate and your faith”.  Akka would need to find hope in her faith, while learning to accept her fate. </p>

My grandparents' first child was a daughter. They named her Sethubai. As was common in Maharashtra, the name included the postfix “bai,” meaning “lady.” Sethubai was my eldest aunt, my father's sister. I remember her as a soft-spoken, gentle person who worked hard for her family and accepted life with a quiet smile. I got to know Sethubai, in her later years. Sethubai had the sweetest demeanor. 

Following Sethubai, another daughter, Satya, was born. Akka said, ”Satya was her father's pet.”

Tragedy would soon strike the family again. Akka lost several children to childbirth and illness. She would recall losing a boy and a girl on the same day to pneumonia. They had contracted it while they were out playing. With no medical care available, she and my grandfather could only watch helplessly as their children slipped away. Ratna. My aunt writes, "Ny father bundled them both his children in a blanket and carried them on his shoulders to the cremation grounds." As was the custom in her time, women were not allowed to go to the burial grounds. Akka could not say her last goodbyes. Ratna writes, about my grandfather, “He was so sad. When he came back home, he patted Akka and said, ‘Tolerate as best you can. We are helpless.’” I still remember Akka closing her eyes in silence, when she talked to me about the children she lost. There can't be any erasure of that pain. Akka had 11 children and only 5 grew up to be adults. Akka resolved, " I will have to do my best for the ones I have with me."

In 1929, came my father, Gopinath Srinivas Rao. Everyone called him "Gopi." As their only son, he would carry on the family name, and they doted on him. He, too, was light-skinned and had green eyes.

After him came Ratna, who was dark-skinned with black eyes and petite. My grandfather told Akka, "Do not neglect this dark child. She is like me. Give her a good education." 

Finally, Manjula was born—a sweet and kind woman who would later become very dear to me.

With their meager resources, Akka worked tirelessly to hold the family together. She stitched clothes for her children by hand, often from a single ream of cloth that my grandfather brought home. I can visualize all the kids wearing the same patterned outfits, hand stitched by their mother. In her spare time, she learned to knit, embroider, and sketch, and she became an accomplished singer of devotional songs. Despite her third-grade education and the immense hardships she faced, Akka found the motivation to pursue her interest in the arts. Akka also made handicrafts with beads and other material. I have with me, a glass bottle into which she had arranged various childhood play things.

The children became the center of Akka’s world. She had been deprived of her mother at a very young age and she wanted to make sure that her young children would feel an abundance of mother’s love. 

In keeping with the customs of her time, Akka had arranged Sethubai’s marriage when she was 11. She was to marry Prahalad Rao. He was an educated young man and could speak english very well. I remember him as an avid fan of cricket.  He was a proud man. He did not get close to Akka or her family. Akka and my grandfather were concerned that he would not be affectionate towards their daughter. He was a close family relative and that was likely what prompted the marriage agreement. Sethubai must have been a very pretty as a young woman. She was very fair skinned with light eyes, just like her mother. Prahalad Rao worked at a silk factory in Mysore, boiling silk worm cocoons, that would later be weaved into fine silk cloth. The fumes from the boiling pots affected his lungs. He quit work at 40. They had a meager existence past that point. Ratna writes, “Sethubai eagerly helped others whenever it was needed. She considered it important to pay back the help she received in her times of need. ”

My grandfather had started practicing “Ayurveda”, a form of Indian medicine. Akka helped him grind up the herbs, roots and barks that he used to make the medicine. 

On a side note, grandpa’s home name  was “Kaushik”. My wife and I named our younger son “Kaushik”, not knowing that that was his great grandfathers name. 

Doddanna had married for the third time and had sons. If his sons mis-behaved or got bad scores on their report cards, Doddanna would send them to Akka’s house to learn discipline and the value of hard work. They called her Akka as “elder sister”. Sethubai and Satya also started calling her Akka. The name has stuck to this day. 

These are the only siblings of Akka I recall being discussed. There was a time when my dad said he would make plans to visit his step-uncles in Hassan. I don’t believe he was able to make the time for the journey. 
## The Widow's Burden
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a">The Widow's Burden</font>

it was 1943. My father was 14 years old. By this time my grandfather’s career was progressing well and he had earned the respect of his superiors. Ratna writes,” He was very sincere at his job and worked hard in his assignments. He had earned respect within the Mysore Palace office.”

He was assigned to support a village fair in Nanjangud, a neighboring town. There was to be a celebration in honor of the god “Shiva”. It was anticipated that there would be a large number of people at the festivities. He was assigned the task of organizing the event. 

Grandfather returned home from Nanjangud with a fever that would not subside. His illness got diagnosed as Cholera. It is not clear if that determination was a best guess or was a considered diagnosis. Ratna writes, “He breathed his last 24 hours later. “ He was 54 years old. 

In his final hours, my grandfather looked at Akka and said, "My chances of survival are low. I am sorry to be leaving the responsibilities of four kids to you."

This was a devastating blow. Akka was only 43. This was the biggest in a series of grave losses in her life. This would leave her with disastrous consequences. In addition to grieving the loss of her husband, she would had to care for her children on her own. The eldest being 18 and the youngest, nine. My Grandpa’s passing meant that Akka's family would lose their source of livelihood. Her children would be deprived of education due to lack of resources. Food and medicine would become scarce. The lives of her two unmarried daughters would be compromised and their marriage prospects diminished. She had not been allowed to gain any marketable skills. She had to raise her kids to lead happy lives. She had all these thoughts swirling in her mind. 

Akka had to make very personal changes in her life. As was the tradition she would have to have her head shaved, wear a simple turmeric-stained saree with no upper garment, and commit to eating only one meal a day. She would have learn to look upon herself as an undesirable at family events and and places of worship. She would have to be an observer at her own children's weddings. I can only imagine how she felt as she contemplated these changes. 

Akka had faced a progression of adversity from losing a mother as a child, to losing children to child birth as a young adult, and now her husband had left their fledgling family. Each time, she had been a bystander to the life's happenings. She had accepted consequences as dictated by society and tradition. She was once again faced with similar choices. it seemed like she would have no control on what happens next.

In my conversations with Akka and Ratna, I have come to believe that this was the beginning of a pivot in the journey of her life. She made a conscious choice to maintain all traditions and societal impositions on herself, but depart radically from these, in how she would create and nurture opportunities for her children. She used the austerity she had imposed on herself as a counter weight that she would leverage, to grant her the permission to create a set of opportunities for her children and free them from the burdens she had to endure. She would give them the freedom to reach their potential without judgement or reservations. She used her own austerity to hold herself together, in dignity, in a society that she had emerged from.

She would adhere to her austerity, driven not by a need to comply or impress. She would cast aside the 'shields of pretend protections' that her society offered. She would use the strength she cultivated in discipling herself, to direct the freeing of her next generation.

Akka adhered to her austere regimen for the rest of her life. 

When I stayed with her during my education in Bnagalore, she was almost 80, I remember a barber, who would come by to shave her head. It had to be done in the veranda outside the house. Even after all the years, I remember seeing the indignity of the experience on her face. Not only was it a frequent re-living of her husbands passing, but it was her submission to the indignity and a reminder that somehow she was to be penalized for a loss that she was innocent of.  Nobody forced her to do this. I remember her telling me, “it is my way of life. I would be uncomfortable any other way”. I remember sitting with her afterward and thinking to myself - this must have so strengthened her resolve to encourage her children to break all barriers in their own lives. it was the her way way of bringing forth the rebellion she was suppressing inside of her.

Her austerity advertised her misfortune and warned others to stay away. Society offered her no mercy and no opportunities. Akka was left to rely on the kindness of a few, but mostly on her own courage, and the belief that her fledgling family's togetherness could see them through. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Akka did what THEY thought was right, for herself,  so she could allow herself to do what SHE thought was right for her children.</p>

## Finding a Path Forward
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a">Finding a Path Forward</font>

The year was 1944.  Grandfather had just passed away. 

Doddanna, Akka’s father, came to her rescue as much as he could. He helped her sell her house and clear the loan that was taken from the palace office. I remember hearing that the mortgage amount was Rs 3,850. Doddanna deposited the money left over from the sale, into a co-operative bank account - a sort of credit union, so that Akka could earn a small interest for her living needs. My father was given a hardship allowance of Rs18 from the palace office. Akka had to mange her monthly expenses within this income. There were no electricity bills, as they did not have electricity in the home. They used kerosene lamps for light. 

Akka’s father-in-law did not come forward to assist. In a culture that carriesthe paternal last name forward, he did not consider it his responsibility to protect his own name for future generations. I say this because Ratna writes, “He did not consider it his responsibility to care for Akka and her family”. However, he did return the two and a half parcels of land that was given to him as dowry at Akka’s marriage. This was of great help to Akka. She was able to feed her kids with the food it provided.

The small parcel of land produced enough rice paddy to feed the family of five, with a little left over to barter for other of life’s necessities. The land was tilled by farmers, who after consuming what they needed, would drop off the excess to Akka’s house. The farmers were kind to her. They would also bring over other items that grew in her land out of season. I remember Akka telling me, “They would bring her the farm produce once a month on a bullock cart. “I was very grateful to them. I would cook a meal for them before they set off on their way back.”, she said.

Prahalad Rao, Sethunai’s husband offered no help. There were times, my dad tells me, that as a teenager, when he would visit Sethubai, he would be shunned and left standing outside the house. 

Doddanna would visit every now and again and bring whatever food items he could from his own field. 

From these sources of monthly income, Akka would clear the house rent and the food needs first, and then pay for school fees, books and pencils. 

Akka considered her children’s education as the primary means to secure their  future. It was something she never had. She understood the consequences all too well. She approached the schools head master to forgive the Rs 2 in fees. That request was graciously granted.  She was however required to pay Rs 0.25 as a compulsory payment that could not be waived. Akka was told, by neighbors and other family members, "why do you want to spend so much on your daughter education. They will get married and go away". She wasn't going to have any of it. She made sure that her remaining children, including her Ratna and Manjula, graduated from university.

Akka's independent spirit must have been a source for consternation for her. I remember her telling me, "People saw my challenge of the norms as a threat to the established system that they prided themselves on." Widows were supposed to be meek and submissive. Akka said to me once, "when things go wrong we bear the consequences, no matter if it is a result of choices made by us, or a result of following directives of others." She did what was right for her to do.

Much later, in 1975, Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, declared a state of emergency. Within that framework, the law was changed to where ownership of the land went to the farmer tilling the soil. He would no longer required to share the crop with the land owner. The law was meant to protect the farmer from indentured servitude to the feudal landlords. Akka had no choice. She did not have the resources to contest the ruling on grounds of hardship. Akka had to cede to the forces of a changing nation.

The farmers continued to be kind to her. They would occasionally stop by and bring over produce. Eventually that petered out. Theirs was a relationship built over the ages. They knew the value of the food they brought for Akka. The land was Akka's only inheritance from her grandfather. It was a source of consistent support for Akka's family for three generations. It wasn't much by today's measure, but she valued it immensely. it was now taken away from her. She mentioned to me once, "indira Gandhi kicked poor people like me in the stomach." Akka was deprived of a source of income that was handed down to her. In her mind, she would now be totally dependent on her children. By this time she did not have a need for it, as her children were settled, but it was a remnant of support that gave her family food during all her time of need.

Ratna tells me that Akka was a strict disciplinarian when it came to her children’s study. There was to be no cutting of corners. Akka's step brothers were often sent over to study under her supervision.  

 Every evening, Akka would gather her children around her and have them recite multiplication tables and poems. She reviewed their calendars and required them to practice their English. She had a limited understanding of content of their lessons, but it was important to her that they studied well. 
 
 Dinner was a simple meal. It comprised of rice and lentils, eaten with a side of vegetables. The farmers brought some vegetables from her land that Akka would store. On special occasions she would buy vegetables from the street vendors. The meals ended with rice and buttermilk eaten with a spicy pickle made with lemon. The children sat around her, on the floor of her small kitchen. She made little morsel sized balls of food and placed it in each child’s hand. Ratna writes,” the food always tasted better, when she did this for us.“

During the festival of Dasera, Akka, would take out her collection of dolls and arrange them for the neighborhood kids to see.  She had made the dolls when her kids were young. She had made them with with clay and stitched clothes for them. During the days of Dasera, another hindu festival, she would make entire village scenes, complete with stores selling sweets for the kids and grains for the parents.  She also added, stores that sold cloth, railway stations, schools and parks. Ratna remembers this vividly. Ratna writes,”there was even a fountain in the park. We would light tiny oil lamps for light. Later your father learnt to rig up flashlight bulbs with a battery. “

Akka had a strong belief in her faith. She believed in faith's power to heal. Ratna writes, “Akka would take her kids to Chamundi hills to thank the residing deity for their health. There were 1,200 steps to climb to the temple. She went there with her kids for five successive Friday’s to pray for the family's wellbeing. “The passing of her husband and kids to illnesses in the past, made her very thankful for the kids well-being today”.

As the children grew older, Doddanna made arrangements for Akka to move to a new rental house in Mysore, that had an outhouse behind it. The house was in one corner of a complex of palace outhouses that was being used as a stable to house elephants. Akka was able to rent out the outhouse for a recurring income. 

The tenant of this outhouse had a nephew named Ramchandra Rao. He had completed high school and was employed at the “Shimsha Electric Company”.  The next generation were already seeing opportunities that Akka’s generation did not. Ramchandra Rao, would later marry my aunt Satya.

Sathya, Akka's second daughter, had completed middle school. She wanted to study further. I remember her as bright and feisty person. I remember thinking of her as being very much like Akka. She did well in her studies. But, Akka burdened Satya with the responsibilities of marriage at an early age. Akka felt it was more important to see her married. It would secure her long term future. Settling Satya's marriage would give the other 3 kids a bigger share of Akka’s meager resources and attention. Settling Satya's marriage was Akka's responsibility. My Dad was too young to assist in any marriage arrangements for his sister. 

 It was arranged that Satya be married to Ramchandra Rao. The wedding was celebrated at a neighbor’s, Mr & Mrs Nanjappa’s, home. The Nanjappa's were a kind people. They were well wishers of Akka. 

Sathya went to live with her husband, near the Shimsha hydro electric plant. The plant was built in 1939, in the Shimshapura valley, by the then ruler of Mysore state. Satya and Ramchandra Rao went on to have 5 kids of their own.

Both Sethubai and Satya were to become mothers at about the same time. As was the custom of the day, it fell upon Akka to care for, and pay for any expenses, the two mothers might incur during their pregnancy. This was an expense that Akka could ill afford. The children were born healthy and Akka became a grandmother to a boy and a girl. She must have been very happy to receive her first grandkids. 

To meet the expenses, Akka sold the entire supply of rice paddy she got from the harvest season. There would be no food for the remaining three kids for the rest of the year. Akka's father, Doddanna came to her rescue again, supporting them through that very difficult year. 

It was not expected that Akka’s son-in-laws would help with their children, until they were a couple months old and they came back from their grandma's house. Even though the son-in-laws could afford their family's care, societal custom demanded that Akka should carry the expense. She would be considered derelict in her duty if she did not. 

It seems to me that at some point shortly after Satya marriage, Akka had fully transitioned to making independent choices for her children, irrespective of the demands made by her time. She afforded my father, Ratna and Manjula a very different set of opportunities.

I often wonder what she might have achieved if she had been a man in these circumstances. 

## A New Chapter in Bangalore
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a">A New Chapter in Bangalore</font>

Akka's first challenge came after my father graduated from his intermediate studies. It was common practice of the time to have the first born son take up a job as soon as possible, so that he could take on the responsibilities of running the household. The job would establish the son as the man of the house. It would give the family stability which would bode well for Ratna and Manjula. It would make things easier to arrange suitable marriages for both of them.

But Akka had different plans. She wanted to give my dad an opportunity to go to college. He was a bright student. It would mean more sacrifices for her and her 2 daughters. But, she decided that it was the right thing to do for her son. 

Akka thought that my father should study medicine. She thought that my father might have inherited an interest for medicine from his father who was practicing the Ayurvedic form of medicine in his time. There was a medical college in Mysore and that would would have been less disruptive to the family. There would still be a lot of considerations - Would he get admission? How would they afford the fees? What other challenges would he face?

My father however, wanted to study engineering. After much thought, Akka decided that my father would do well in the study of his choice. After much thought, she decided to support his wishes. Akka had no specific experience with what engineering would provide for her son and her family.  Mysore prided itself on engineering accomplishments of the time. There was an engineering college in Mysore. Akka came to understand that the engineering college in Bangalore was rated higher - most likely my father expressed his desire to go to Banglore as it was a bigger city with more opportunities. 

Given her circumstances, this just not to be done. Entertaining the thought of uprooting the family, finding a way to make living is a new city, just to support your sons ambition, while local options were available, would have made no sense to most people in her time. there was so much to loose from what little she had. It would be considered lunacy to jeopardize their future, when a job in the local civic administrations would have set a far more stable course for the family. But Akka had decided that she could endure. she had decided that she cannot take the much trodden path, if her children were to break the mold. She had confidence in her son. She had faith in herself.

Akka decided she must go to Bangalore with my Dad to help through the admissions process. Akka was able to get an appointment to meet a Captain Krishnamurthy in Bangalore. He was on the selection committee at the BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore. Captain Krishnamurthy’s mother was Akka’s friend and she had kindly agreed to setup the meeting. Akka got a break when Captain Krishnamurthy agreed to help my  navigate the admissions process. With the good Captain's help, my father was able to get a seat at the engineering college of his choice based on his grades at high school. Akka had taught my father well. He had kept his education front and center. This was the first big break for my father and Akka made it possible.

At about the same time, the neighbor (Mr & Mrs Nanjappa) at whose house, Sathya’s wedding was celebrated in Mysore, moved to Bangalore. Akka spoke to them and aske dif they might be able to assist my father get situated. They offered my Dad a free room to live in and one free meal a day. 

My father moved to Bangalore and stayed with the Nanjappa family. He found a small job at a tailors shop college to the house. The tailor offered him a bicycle as payment. This was a significant time saver and it allowed my father to the time to offer Teutons to make a little money for his expenses.

Akka was concerned for my fathers well-being as he was with no real means. she did not like the idea of my father having to ask for a free meal everyday. She convinced herself that Bangalore might present better opportunity for Ratna and Manjula. it was to be more uncertainty and settling would take time. She discussed her dilemma with Doddanna and he once again came to her assistance. 

Doddanna was getting up there in years. His funds and his influence was diminishing. He had his own family to support. Doddanna remained steadfast in his support for Akka. Even if he did not have the funds, he provided encouragement to Akka. He had always been a source of strength for Akka and supported her unconventional journey. I have come to believe that Akka and Doddanna were like minded people.  

Doddanna helped Akka move to Bangalore. They moved to a small rental place in Chamarajpet, a neighborhood in Bangalore city. However, this meant that she would no longer be receiving the paddy from her land. Bangalore was too far away for the farmers to deliver the paddy. 

My father, continued with tutoring to pay for his college tuition. Doddanna continued to send some money for expenses, whenever he could. Akka had a few gold coins, gifted by the palace, to my grandfather, as a commendation for jobs well done. Akka took a loan from Mr  & Mrs Nanjappa and put up the gold coins as collateral. My father’s fees was Rs20 per month. Today, I have no idea where the gold coins are. I would have treasured them immensely, if I had them. 

Ratna also stopped her studies, which she was pursuing in Mysore, to work as a tutor to assist with household expenses and to pay back her mother’s loan. She worked at a nearby school as a substitute teacher. Eventually she was able to restart her education and completed her studies. Ratna was awarded a Bachelor of science degree from Bangalore university. 

Akka had given my father a new beginning, with nothing more than determination and courage to help her along the way. She was very proud of my father's accomplishment.

## My father moves to SIkhim
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a">A New Chapter in Bangalore</font>

My father graduated from engineering school in 1956. He applied for and was selected for a job in Sikkim. He was offered a job as a civil engineer doing land surveys for the state’s public works department. He was going to be paid Rs 75 per month. The state of Sikhim is located in the eastern Himalayas and borders China (Tibet), Bhutan, Nepal and West Bengal.

SIkhim is a very distant place. It has a culture very different from Bangalore. It might as well be a different country. Different food, clothes, religion and pretty much everything there be unfamiliar to Akka. It was everything Akka had been warned against—leaving the community for foreign lands…

Akka had not discouraged my father from applying for the job. It was probably a long shot and she felt he would pick something closer to home. but that was not to be. Akka felt that if my father went to Sikhim, he would not be able to visit very often. It was far away, she could not comprehend the distance. Without a man in the house, the three women would have to fend for themselves. It was also a place she could not move to. It would be too much of a change for her to undertake. Hasan, Mysore and Bangalore wher all in the same state and she had grown up familiar with the poeple and culture.

Once again she had to contend with her son moving further. Akka, Ratna and Manjula had put their heart and soul into helping my father when he moved to Bangalore. There would be no way she could do this in SIkhim. She felt helpless. She had to resolve in her own mind, whether she would ask him to stay back for the sake of the family or pursue his opportunities as they came to him. She was older now. And, so were her daughters, who were still single. She was worried for them. People were already making comments to her that their marriage was not arranged. She also worried for my father.

After much thought, Akka concluded that she had already made this decision. When my father first moved to Bangalore, her considerations were similar.  She had to keep along this path she had chosen. It was going to be tough, but she was going to support each child to her fullest ability. The difference this time was distance. The job was in a remote area of Skihim and infrastructure there would be poor as would any communication abck to bangalore.

In all these considerations, there wasn't a hint of selfishness in Akka's mind. Akka's thoughts were always guided by the best interests of her children. Was she allowing her son to do something wrong?  A priest from the Ramakrishna Ashram had came to visit her. He asked, "Why are you sending your only son so far away? It is not the right to leave one's community and culture and go to foreign lands." Akka replied, "If I say no, how can he progress and have a bright future? I do not want my struggle to become his. I will see him off willingly.”. And she did.

It was very difficult for Akka to see my Dad leave. She never told me this in so many words, but I got a sense, from Ratna, of the emotions she felt the night before his leaving. The son she had had raised on her own, was moving far away. Was he going to be ok? What if he fell sick? She had worked so hard to keep the family together so they could lean on each other. With all these thoughts swirling in her mind she let him leave for Sikhim with her blessings.  She had to do the best she knew, for her son. She would would miss him.  She needed to be strong for her daughters too.

I remember a very different situation with my mother, as I was leaving for the US. It was the usual hot July in Bombay, in 1985. I was to go to Kuwait to get my US visa. If I got the visa, I would go to SUNY Buffalo, NewYork, to study for a masters degree in mechanical engineering. My father had made all the arrangements. He would travel with me to New York city. I would proceed on my own to Buffalo. My father and I were to spend the night at a hotel on park avenue. My mother waived to me from the balcony of our house in Bombay. I remember her saying, “Take care. We will come see you in the summer.“ - So very different from Akka’s experience when my father first moved away. 

My father was able to send a little money home.  Two years into his job at Sikhim, my father responded to an advertisement for job as a Junior Engineer in Air India, Bombay. Air India was the fledgling national carrier of India. My father surely considered this a prestigious opportunity. The job  offered a significantly higher pay. Culturally he thought that Akka and sisters would find the capital city of Maharashtra appealing. Akka already spoke the language “marathi”, although with a pronounced accent. 

He already knew he would have Akka's blessing for this one. One of his cousins, Naga was already in Bombay working as an accountant and Akka knew of his wellbeing. Also Bombay was culturally and physically closer to Bangalore then Sikhim.

 He applied for the job and was accepted. There would be an apprentice program to get through first. The apprentice salary was Rs 300 per month. Upon completing the apprenticeship, and being accepted into the job, his salary would rise to Rs 375 per month. Bombay was an expensive place to live. My father contacted his cousin, Naga, and they decided to share a small room in Matunga, a predominantly South Indian suburb of Bombay.

## Bombay 
![[] <font color="#f09e5a"> Bombay</font>

Things began to look up for my father. 

My father was able to send Rs 20 each month to Akka for expenses. Ratna had graduated and had started tutoring again. The headmistress of a nearby school was impressed with Ratna's work and offered her a job as a science teacher in her school. 

Akka was able to take a deep breath. A small but stable income would go a long way towards providing a sense of security. It was a long journey for her and her family to get to this point. She felt like she had finally made it all work. 

Akka set about trying her daughters married. It was a responsibility she had taken on with my grandpa, and she was determined to see it through. Having made it this far, this would be her next priority. 

While in Bombay, my father met my mother, Shanta. My mother was from the same caste. Her family had migrated from Tamil Nadu, in 1929. Although they spoke Kannada, their accent was very different and culturally my maternal grand parents felt a stronger affinity to Tamil Nadu than to Karnataka. My mom was born in 1935. She had lived in Bombay all her growing years. She studied at an english convent school, and later went to St. Xavier’s college in the city center. She spoke English well. She was employed at the state owned Life Insurance Corporation of India. 

Although my father and mother agreed to marry, my mother's parents and Akka had to grant their permission before the marriage could be formalized. Akka had her concerns. My mother was not from the same community, nor of the same cultural background. Akka did not know her or her parents. This was probably very unusual situation for Akka. First the job, and then this. Notwithstanding these concerns, she gave my parents her blessings. 

They were married in 1959. 

Bombay is a big city, with a big city culture - People of many backgrounds thrown together. Scarce resources, but many opportunities. It was beginning to be the hub of commerce, as India had come into its own after independence from the British. The modern era ushered in an airport at Santa Cruz. Bombay was beginning to be a window to the world for well to-do Indians. Money lenders, traders, writers, people from all walks to life competed fiercely with each other to get a foothold in the city. 

Bombay was a very different place from Mysore. My father was lucky to have a job with a state-private corporation like Air India. It presented him with many opportunities that would not have been available to him in Bangalore.  He worked in a modern technology company,  with modern processes implemented by Boeing. Being a mechanical engineer he developed a skill in aircraft maintenance and airworthiness support. He obtained many licenses and certifications that helped him rise in the company. In his time with Air India, he got to travel to many distant parts of the world.  

My mother worked at LIC for a year after her marriage and then decided to stay home.  They had rented a small house in a suburb of Bombay. I was born in 1962. 

Akka meanwhile continued her life in Bangalore. She was happy that my father had moved closer and had secured a good job. She was probably thinking of exploring marriage proposals for him, but her priority would have to be her two daughters. As yet, she had been unable to settle Ratna or Manjula in marriage. Not surprising, as these discussions were traditionally to be initiated and managed by a man. It was difficult for a widow to break through these barriers. It was much easier for Akka to arrange the marriages of Sethubai and Sathya, because she had the support of Doddanna and he must have had some influence in the small town of Hassan. 

Doddanna had left Akka by this point. I am not aware of the circumstances of his passing. Akka lost the one person who was consistently there for her.

My father, with my mother's tacit agreement,  requested Akka and his sisters to join him in Bombay. this was a common practice at the time, and continues to be so, to this day. The eldest son is expected to live with his parents and care for them. 
## Akka's joins my father in Bombay 
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a"> The Bangalore Years</font> 

It was 1962. Akka was 61 years old. She was 2 years younger than I am today. She had just received an invite from my father to consider a move to Bombay.

Akka was elated. It was a confirmation that her solo efforts, spanning over 2 decades, in navigating the perils of marginal living, were beginning to take hold. Her son had been married for three years and she began to sense a degree of confidence in his tone. He was going to be able to support his fledgling family and also help stabilize her daughters future. This is what she had worked towards all along. She began to looking forward to seeing his success first hand. My parents were expecting me at this point and she felt that moving to Bombay would give her the added pleasure of seeing a new grandchild up close.

Staying with your son is the norm in India. It is so to this day. Akka considered that Ratna and Manjula, who had sacrificed as much as they did, would finally get a break in Bombay. She also considered the situation that when Ratna and Manjula got married, it would not make sense for her to live alone. She could not live in her daughters household - She would not have a place there. She would have to move and live with her son. This is how things happened in most families. Why not initiate the process now and smoothen the transition for everyone?

My father also expressed his desire to actively support his sisters. He had been a beneficiary of all of Akka's efforts and blessings, and he was eager to do his part to help them settle in Bombay. His career was going well and aside from normal day-to-day life, there really wasn't much reason to not have his mother stay with him. Soon he would be able to rent a larger apartment and things would be easier for everyone. My father felt a sense of urgency in arranging a marriage for his sisters.

With support from both my parents, Akka felt confident that she would make the move a success. She would be an active supporter of my father and mothers career choices and pitch in to help with their growing family needs as best she could. She had always worked for her family and this would be no different. She fully expected that Ratna and Manjula would be settled soon in their own lives. With a little bit of luck she would be able to partake in the joy of three growing families. She could look forward to a relaxed life in her aging years. 

Initially, Rathna thought she would stay back in Bangalore and not go to Bombay with Akka. My Dad insisted that Ratna should also move to Bombay. As Ratna writes, “Akka said, 'My son is calling me for a good purpose — to support him and his siblings, and I must do it for that reason. I must not say no. It is the right thing to do.'” Akka moved to Bombay in early 1962. 

In Bombay, Ratna was able to get a job while also continuing her education in teaching. Her pay was not sufficient to pay for her very basic expenses. Bombay was an expensive city. She had to depend in my father for financial help. 

My maternal grandparents lived in Bombay in their own house. My grandmothers name was 'Jayyu'. She came from very humble beginnings in a remote village of a neighboring state of Tamil Nadu. When her sister, who was married to my grandfather at the time, passed away at childbirth, it was decided by the elders in the family, that my grandfather would marry Jayyu. My grandfather 'Mama' moved to Bombay in 1929. Jayyu soon joined him there. He took a job at 'All India Radio' and they had a fairly smooth transition. They had rented a house in Dadar, a suburb of Bombay. Jayyu had 2 daughters, my mother and her younger sister.

Jayyu did not face the struggles that Akka did. She even had her mother stay with her in Bombay. Mama was a a quiet, agreeable person. He supported Jayyu in all matters relating to family life. He was a good provider for his family. Jayyu and Mama went on to live into their 80's.

Like Akka, Jayyu harbored a fear of life's uncertainties, but she dealt with it in a very different way. She became domineering and controlling of all things and all people in a bid to protect herself against all adversity. There was never any real threat to her familiy, but she became suspicious of anyone coming close to them. She controlled all aspects of her children's life. Jayyu had daughters, and they would one day marry and leave her home. She did not come to terms with that possibility. In her mind she was offering them the best protection she could against life's perils. She labelled this as 'Love' for her family. Mama's temperament rendered him unable to challenge her methods. Growing up my mother had no option but to concede to all her mother's wishes. She would never be able to challenge Jayyu.

Akka was unaware of the situation that she would face. There was to be significant consternation soon after Akka, Ratna and Manjula arrived in Bombay. Jayyu saw Akka and her family as a threat to her established control over her daughter's life and future.  Jayyu surely sensed a similar threat when my parents decided to marry, but she likely felt she would be able to maintain her control, notwithstanding a son-in-law's presence. She had given them her permission to marry.

Akka had accepted my parents invite assuming that they would work out the details. My father motivated by his sense of duty to his mother, assumed that with my mother's help, they would be able to handle Jayyu's need for control and dominance. 

As it turned out, my father completely misjudged the situation and his own ability to influence either my mother or Jayyu. Neither him nor my mother were able to keep their end of the bargain. Their marriage started off to a very rocky start.

By now, Akka had been in Bombay for 18 months. The situation was going from bad to worse with each passing day. All hopes that Akka had for a new life in Bombay, were dashed. With these goings on, Akka was unable to settle a marriage for Ratna or Manjula. This could not continue. Akka had to make a decision. With a heavy heart, Akka, Ratna, and Manjula decided to leave Bombay and head back Bangalore.

I have often wondered that if they had stuck together for another year or two, would they have been able to make a better life for all in Bombay. Having known Jayyu in my later years, I have since concluded that this would have been a very unlikely outcome. My parents would have had to establish and maintain strict boundaries with Jayyu from day one. They were unable to do this. Flexibility was not an option Jayyu ever considered.

Akka left hoping she would find the resolve to resume her struggle and that of her daughters in Bangalore. This was devastating outcome for Akka. It was the realization that her hopes and aspirations her daughters were misplaced. That door had shut and there would be no going back.

Ratna writes (talking about me), “ At the time we left, you were a year old baby. When we bid goodbye to you at the train station, you lifted your arms, crying, like you wanted to come with us to Bangalore”

Thinking back, it is a deep and tearful moment for me, as it must have been for Akka, Ratna and Manjula. It would be a long, silent 24 hour train ride to Bangalore.

## The Bangalore Years 
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a"> The Bangalore Years</font> 

Akka made plans to start over in Bangalore. She did not have a choice. The biggest challenge as Akka once told me, was "I cannot become a burden to Ratna and Manjula. I have to be careful. They have their own challenges. Society is not supportive of young women making their way forward in life without a man. I have to protect them."

Ratna was in her thirties by this time. As a result of recent occurrences, Ratna took the decision to differ marriage conversations to a future time. It was her way of saying that other things would have to take a higher priority. Stable income, housing, healthcare, getting Manjula married - All these would have to come before her own marriage intentions. Ratna could only share these intentions with Akka in small doses. She did not want Akka to consider Ratna's decision as her own failure. Ratna decided that she would need to take the lead and be the man of the house. Akka had taught her well.

The first thing Ratna would need is stable employment. The Bombay episode had disrupted her career path. She would have to start over. Her confidence was shaken. The Indian economy was in its nascent stages and job prospects were poor. It was also uncommon for a thirty old unmarried woman to look for a job. The prevailing opinion of the time was that she should be looking to get married and not go out looking for a job. Ratna felt that marriage would leave Akka and Manjula alone and unable to fend for themselves. She would have to make running the house a priority and a success. Rathna never married.

Ratna applied for a teaching position at a number of local schools. She eventually found a temporary position at the school she had taught earlier. Luckily for her, a vacancy opened up and she was confirmed to a permanent teaching position at the school. 

After staying in a series of temporary places, Ratna was able rent a small house on Ratnavilas Road, in a residential suburb of Basavanagudi. This is where Akka and Ratna would stay for the next 20 years.

Ratna would now receive a steady salary and could plan a life with Akka. This seemed like a start of something stable and sustainable. 

Akka, began to make Bangalore her home, again. She accepted the terms that life had handed to her. Akka was not a meek person. Her family would not have survived if she was. She had courage and strength. She understood life. She understood struggle. She gave respect and she received it. She managed her challenges with grace, dignity and integrity.  There were many occasions for despair in her life experiences, but she carried herself well. In a society that was unforgiving and judgmental, she managed to keep her head above negativity. She was older now and she tired easily.

She slowly integrated herself back into her community, making friends with neighborhood ladies who would come to visit. Akka became their confidant. They would share their concerns and Akka would wisely suggest patience and tolerance. Ratna writes, ”Akka would tell them, ‘you have to learn to get along with family, otherwise you will have to learn to learn to live with loneliness, which is a much steeper price.” For Akka, family togetherness was everything. She would tell people, “You only find what you are looking for”, “Look for the good in people, and they will offer that good to you.” Her friends remarked to Ratna afterwards, “Ajji (grandmother) tells us old stories that she heard as a child. We love to listen to her”. 

When people came to visit, she would offer them coffee. Ratna always left coffee for her in a flask before she left for work.  Akka would knit sweaters when Ratna was at work. Ratna would get the knitting started for her, and she wold continue with the pattern. When Ratna returned Akka would ask Ratna to verify that none of the stitches got away. Akka was never one to sit idle.  She was always knitting sweaters or making cane hand bags. Ratna has given me memento of Akka’s craftwork that I treasure to this day. 

There would always be a strong reaction from Akka if she came across unfair treatment of women or children. I remember many an occasion during my 3 years with Akka, when she would scold menfolk in her extended family, for not doing the right thing. She had a unique way of handling these things. She kept the relationship going, but she never failed to make her thoughts known. I have known her fearlessly separate right from wrong. I have seen her consistency of thought.  Her word could be trusted. For all the hardships she faced, Akka was easily the strongest person in her clan. Maybe it was the hardships she faced that made her so. Maybe it was her good relationship with her father, who was also a strong man. Maybe it was the responsibility that she had to bear at a very early age. 

Akka’s eyesight was getting worse. Her doctor told her that she needed a cataract operation. Ratna was able to pay for the operation from her savings. Akka reached out to Mr Nanjuppa, who by this time was well connected in the Bangalore community. He agreed to help. He was able to get the operation scheduled at a reputed hospital in Bangalore. Ratna writes, "Akka prayed she would be able to see well again, before she went to the hospital."

The operation did not go well. Akka continued to lose her sight. Akka was told that a second operation might help, but there would only be a 50% chance that her vision would recover after the 2nd operation. Akka decided to not go forward with the second operation. 

Her eyes were failng her. On good days she could see silhouettes. She slowly adjusted to life without sight. She lost her sight, not her spirit. Ratna writes, ”Akka said, ‘What if I loose my eyes? Ratna and Manjula are my eyes. ‘ “

In 1977, Akka was able to settle Manjua’s marriage to Mr. Jamkhandi. My father was able to help with Manjula’a wedding. Manjula was in her late thirties by then. Manjula was very happy. The couple lived in Mr. Jamkhandi’s house a mile up the road from Ratna's house. With Ratna and Manjula close by, Akka’s life was at its most stable. Akka was able to take a deep breath.

For Akka, Jamkhandi was a very happy addition to the family. Since Akka couldn’t see, Manjula would come and give her company during the day, when Ratna was away at work. She would head back to her home by 4:00. Akka was very comforted by Manjula's company. 

Manjula would give Akka, “chapatti and some milk” for lunch. She had agreed to having lunch. She was getting weak with age. Jamkhandi also made sure to visit on Thursday evenings and weekends. Akka would wait eagerly for their visit. 

My father had bought Akka a battery operated shortwave radio. It was small in size and she carried it around in a little plastic box. She would listen to the All India Radio news three times a day. This was her favorite favorite thing to do. It also helped her tell time as she couldn’t see the clock. She was also able to cut some vegetables. Manjula let her do this as it was a way for her to keep busy. 

Akka kept busy singing hymns and reciting prayers for people who came to visit. When she was done with the recitation, she would let them know that she prayed that their fears would be gone. It was one of the ways she helped people. Her favorite hymn was one called, “Sundar Kanda”.

She believed that loosing fear was the first step towards solving any problem. Ratna writes,“Akka always said, If you remove fear, then the right solution presents itself”.

Akka believed in rituals. After her daily prayers she would serve holy water. She fasted for an entire day, once a month. This day was called  “Ekadashi” in the hindu calendar. She only ate one meal a day. She said,”I need to give my body some rest.“ In the midst of her strength, there was an innocence to her demeanor. It was very touching.

## My years with Akka 
![[Akka-later.jpg]] <font color="#f09e5a"> My years with Akka</font>

In 1980, my father had returned from one of his visits to Bangalore. Bangalore was growing to be a hub for Engineering schools. There were a significant number of public sector heavy industries in the area, that needed a lot of engineering talent. Mysore, about 90 miles away, had always prided itself as the city that favored engineering. Sir M Vishwesharya, was the city’s premier architect. He oversaw the construction of the KRS dam over the river Kaveri that brought electricity and irrigation to neighboring towns and villages. 

My father decided, I should go the Bangalore, and apply to study at an engineering college there. 

Amongst many things, there are two principle opportunities that were pivotal to my own future.  One, was my father's decision to encourage my study in Bangalore and the other was his decision to encourage and support my study in the USA. I am eternally grateful to my father for these opportunities that he gave to me. 

A major outcome of me studying in Bangalore, was that I was able to stay with Akka. 

At the time I was not aware of Akka's life story. I grew up in Bombay and my father's family background wasn’t talked about much. Jayyu had dominated much of my upbringing. It came as a big shock to her when I told her I was leaving to study in Bangalore and I would be staying with Akka. Jayyu made an attempt to dissuade me, but I did not give her the space to succeed.

Thinking back, I have to admire Akka’s willingness to host a 18 yr old boy in her home. She was 80 yrs old then and her sight was severely compromised. Ratna and Manjula accepted me with open arms too. I am very appreciative of the opportunity they gave to me. I got to know them all. Jamkhandi became a friend to me. 

I was not a difficult kid. But I had very limited awareness and my understanding was nascent at best. Looking back, I wish I had paid more attention and asked more questions of Akka. The lessons I would have learnt from her, would have made my own journey so much more productive. It was my first time away from home. I was more focused on discovering the world, with my new found freedom, than relating the high value people around me. 

I stayed in Ratna's house on Ratnavilas road, all four years of my Bachelors in mechanical engineering. Her house was at the end of a small street called “Ratnavilas Road”, meaning “the street with Ratna’s house”.  This is now hilariously coincidental. This coincidence did not occur to me till after I left the place. 

The house itself was an outhouse. The main house was owned a retired police official. He and his kids and their spouses all lived there. A large house with many people. The owner walked around with a cork hat, like the British used to wear on hunting trips. 

Akka largely kept her distance from that family. She did not think she belonged to their “class”. At this point my father was making a lot of money. Akka still lived the meager life as afforded by Ratna’s school teacher salary. 

I, on the other hand, got a lot of spending money from my father. I had more money than most households in the neighborhood. Akka never told me what to do or how to spend it. My dad bought me a 250cc motorbike. It was an adaptation of the east European “Java”. The Indian version was called “Yezdi”.  I really enjoyed the bike. AKka never said anything about it. 

Akka left disciplining to my dad, which to my joy he did not exercise very often. I was surely wasting money, and given the difficult financial times she faced in the past, I wonder what lessons I might have learned, had I had the wisdom to get to know her better. She had the wisdom to not impose her thoughts on me. 

Akka was able to move around the house and do basic chores. She knew where everything was, by memory. When I came back from my school, and she knew, I had not eaten lunch yet, she would set it up for me. I was very touched by that act.

Akka had missed all of my childhood. I am not sure what her thoughts were about seeing me all grown up. She expressed her love for me in her own way, without any demands or restrictions. 

I do not remember having lengthy conversations with Akka. I had many short ones. I attribute that to my inability to pay attention and explore her perspectives on things I was consumed with. I was also limited by my exposure to culture and language in Bombay.  Bombay was a very different place. My Kannada language was poor. I cannot read or write Kannada.  

I did not know it at that time, but whatever the limits of my understanding, Akka left a very deep and lasting impression with me. I admired her quiet poise, her willingness to engage, her courageous acceptance of life with all its offerings - I just couldn’t express myself in any cohesive manner back then. 

I had to wait till I was grown up, to catch my understanding up to what she would mean to me. 

## Akka’s leaves us 
![[Ratna-later.jpg]] <font color="#f09e5a"> Akka leaves us</font>

Akka’s health was failing. She was in her early 80’s.  Sethubai and Satya would come to stay with her frequently. She had to be pushed in a wheel chair around the house. She could tell  when I pushed her wheel chair. She used to tell Ratna, “Papu brought me here to sit in the sun, by the window. “ she called me Papu. 

Ratna had decided that she would build a small house that she could share with Akka. Akka had never lived in her own house and Ratna wanted to give her that experience. Time was running out.  Ratna began construction and engaged a contractor. The contractor was very honest and he worked at great haste to complete the house in time for Akka. 

During the last month of her life in 1983, Akka began to fall ill frequently. She could see nothing - even the silhouettes were gone. She would eat very little. I could see her hand shanking. By this time, her head was shaking as well, as though she was continuously nodding to herself. Ratna had a doctor come in every evening to check on her. 

Dr. Bhatt was a large, quiet spoken, gentle man. He would stop by around 6:30 on his way home and check on her. He charged Ratna Rs 40 for his visit. Sometime he would prescribe some vitamins and other medicines that I would get for her from a nearby drug store. 

Akka had no blood pressure issues, no diabetes, no anemia. Everything looked normal. But she was visibly growing weak as each day passed. She had always been petite. She began to have difficulty eating.

One evening, Dr. Bhatt came to see Akka. He advised Ratna that AKka needs to be in a hospital as soon as possible.

There were very few cars in the city. There was no ambulance service that was available where Akka lived. The Taxi stand was over a mile away at Gandhi Bazar. I went to the taxi stand. They told me to wait for one to come by. Next to the taxi stand was a horse-cart stand. These horse carts were called 'Jutka' or 'Tonga'. Ratna writes, "You got a jutka as the taxi was not available on that day." I recall that I was able to get a taxi.

Nonetheless, I carried  Akka in my arms from her bed to the taxi. I sat with her, holding her, trying to soften the bumps in the road. We reached the hospital in about 20 minutes. The people in the hospital were very caring towards Akka. They would come and check on her every hour. She was coming in and out of consciousness at this time. Despite all their efforts to strengthen her, Akka passed away 13 days later. There was no pain or suffering. 

Akka never saw the house, Ratna was building for her. 

My father’s cousin Naga, with whom my father stayed when he first went to Bombay, performed Akka’s last rites at the crematorium. I was not allowed in. As per tradition, people with living parents were not allowed in. My father was working in Kuwait at the time.  He had come to see her a fortnight earlier and she seemed to be on the mend. He had to get back to work. It is sad for me that he was not able to make it in time for her last rites and I was not allowed to do it. 

My father rushed back and he was able to perform the 14 days of prayers for Akka’s onward journey. 

For Ratna and Manjula, the loss was immense.  For Ratna, Akka had been her only anchor in life. As per my grandpa’s instruction, Akka had taken good care of Ratna. Ratna in turn, was incredibly devoted to Akka. She gave Akka her full attention and care. They truly took care of each other. It was as if this was a relationship that was leftover from a prior life that needed to be completed in this one. 

Ratna writes,”Aka never left us. She is always there with me in spirit. Even today, I feel she sleeps with me. Her good wishes and blessings are always with us.“ Ratna kept Akka’a transistor radio at her own bedside. It had stopped working by this time. 

After Akka passed away, I was in my final year of B.S. in engineering. I wanted to experience life in the college dorm. Ratna writes, “I am thankful you chose not to go and stayed with me instead.” In hindsight, i should have never thought to leave. 

During COVID, I had asked Ratna if she would write me a few words about how she remembered Akka and Akka’s life experiences.  Ratna wrote me 14 pages of hand written notes. I am ever so grateful to Ratna for doing that. A lot of what I have written here comes from that note. Ratna, in referring to me, asking her to write Akka's memoir, writes, " I thankful to you, Papu, you gave me an opportunity to recall those golden days, full of affection."

Ratna passed away in June 20th, 2024. She was 91.

Ratna has left me as a beneficiary on her bank account that contains Rs14Lakhs, approximately $12,000. This was from the savings she was able to put away after caring for Akkka and herself. I have tremendous respect and value for this money. I will find a good purpose for it in India. 

I hope that my stay in Bangalore gave Akka some sense of comfort. It was the first time she had a son of the family stay with her since my father left in 1956. 

Ratna writes,”I thank everyone that took care of me and Akka. I thank you all. “

Thank you, Ratna — for everything!!!
## A Lasting Memory 
![[]] <font color="#f09e5a"> A Lasting Memory</font>

Akka grew up in a very different time and a very different environment from my own. My children now in the US, are even further away from her way of life. We all welcome advancements in our lives. I am indebted to Akka for having gone through fire, so that I would enjoy these advancements. 

Today, survival is not the issue. The luxuries of modern living, give us the freedom to be individualistic in our choices. This was not always so. 

Today, the support we receive from our community is often disregarded. We forget that, without community support, we will experience a severe degradation in our quality of life. We measure success on a personal level.  We believe our efforts and merits are the primary determinants of our success.  Our desires are a result of ‘ wants’ and not ‘needs’. Before we congratulate ourselves on our successes, we probably ought to pause, to recognize that in every one of our successes, our community has made a pivotal contribution — just like it was, in Akka's time.

Our definition of success has changed considerably too. It is almost as if our contentment is a constantly moving target, that keeps us seeking more and more. It draws on much of our energy, but we are rarely able to define a clear goal at which point we can say 'enough!'. Our approach makes for an incredibly inefficient use of the limited time given to us. As soon as we achieve a degree of contentment, we  consider ourselves lazy or complacent, for not reaching for the next 'thing'. We eventually run out of time, chasing something we never get. I believe that Akka was not a participant in such a vicious cycle. She was required to find contentment in what she had. I do not believe she had a choice. Wouldn’t it be simpler if we could be content as an act of choice? 

In re-living my conversations with Akka, I realized a fundamental difference in her approach. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Akka’s objective was to reduce suffering, not maximize happiness. </p>

This approach made all the difference. She knew when to stop — when she could reduce suffering no more — then, all that was left to do was accept the situation as it was. I find the simplicity of that to be profound.

There is no end state when it comes to maximizing happiness. When do you stop? The pursuit of happiness not achieved in time, is itself a cause of suffering, ,resulting in the eventual acceptance of that unnecessary suffering. Seems so wasteful. I do not believe that Akka had the choice of pursuing happiness. Life was mostly about containing the damage.  AKka had to find peace within that which was offered to her. 

I often think that Akka would have reacted no differently than she did, if she were here today. I believe her behavior was rooted in her upbringing of her time.  

It is revealing to contemplate how little is really needed to live a contented life. Nature has what we need and offers it to us for free. We may not always get it when we want it. Or we may not know where or how to find it. But it is always there. The powers that create these forces to sustain life, might have been considered as divinity in Akka’s mind. She prayed to the divine for gifts of survival and she got it. She expressed her gratitude in prayers.  She prayed for others well-being. Akka knew not to ask for more than her needs. She was aware that many others were seeking the same survival. 

In my present context, it is important for me to remember how I got here. It provides a grounding and a plausible explanation of my current state. It also increases my awareness of the vast number of people who are living in our time, in a condition similar, to how Akka did in her time. It helps me identify with, and appreciate their condition. It helps me appreciate how precarious my own situation is. 

It gives me hope. It gives me examples. It give me humility, knowing that I am the beneficiary of past struggles. The gift given to us, by people before us, is a terrible thing to waste. This has motivated me to write Akka’s story. 

It enforced an understanding of how togetherness matters. When times get tough, some people step up. These are the leaders. For our own sake, they should be heard and respected. They have much to offer. I think of Akka as one such person. 

It gives us the knowledge that we can all move forward with hard work, doing the right things, with integrity and compassion. Akka demonstrated that we have these qualities inside us. There is no need to look for external forces to supplement it. There is no need for excess, greed, or taking from others as though life is a zero sum game. It is not. 

Akka's experiences and challenges were very different and significantly more demanding then mine. 

My attempt to capture, her experience, her resolve to do the right thing, her compassion and respect for people, her willingness to accept the norms of the time, and her desire to not impose them on others, has been incredibly revealing to me.  

Most of all I admire her courage to persevere through life's hurdles with courage and integrity.  I thank her for enriching me with her experience and her perspective. 

Akka gave me a peek into her world. I believe she would be the first to admit that her approach to her work and her life, were probably common place during her time. That may well be true. But I owe her an eternal measure of gratitude, for making it possible for me to know and learn, and from which my life has, and will continue to be, significantly enriched.
