My grandfather, a man of purpose and authority, returned home from Nanjangud with a heat in his bones that wouldn’t break. At 43, my grandmother, Akka, watched helplessly, as her world began to crumble. This wasn’t just a man dying; it was their livelihood, their children’s future and their place in society, slipping away, hour by agonizing hour. <br><br>The prospect of raising her fledgling family alone, took Akka through a series of decisions, the repercussions of which would resonate three generations down. </p>This is the story of Akka's journey.<br><br>When I met Akka in Bangalore as a young adult, I saw a petite, frail, elderly woman, lying in bed in a large, bare room. She had lost most of her sight. I saw her listening to the news on a small transistor radio by her bedside. She enjoyed the feel of the warm morning sunlight that came in from window on the far side of the room.<br><br>When I got to know her, I felt no sadness for her frailty, only respect and pride for someone who had grasped life by overcoming great odds, with courage and integrity. She had learnt to take fear in her stride. In her presence, I sensed an alertness. Her quiet confidence was subtle but visible. There was always a tone of encouragement in her words.

Everybody called her Akka. Akka means ‘older sister’ in Kannada. It is used it as a term of endearment, but also one of respect. Akka, was my father’s mother, my grandmother.<br><br>Growing up, I didn't know Akka very well, but in writing about her now, I am beginning to understand her better. There is much I have learnt about her life in this process. This is my way of paying my respects to her.<br><br>I am also writing this for my sons. Akka passed away before they were born. I want them to see her strength, grace, and compassion and learn to recognize these qualities in their own lives.<br><br>They say,”you see further, standing on the shoulders of those before you”. This is a my way of handing my sons a piece of their legacy, that I received from Akka.<br><br>For anyone else who reads this, I hope it offers a small glimpse into how one courageous but unprepared woman, with only her resolve to guide her, was able to navigate a life of meager means and great peril, transforming it into a legacy of opportunity and success for her future generations.<br><br>In today's world of "in your face" progress, and "I deserve my wants" bravado, contemplating Akka’s journey helps me separate the grain from the chaff. Her life’s story teaches me that the fight for the greater good, even against all odds, can be won with honesty, dignity, and compassion.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

There is no official record of her birth. She was most likely born in her maternal grandmother's home.<br><br>Hassan is a small town in the state of Karnataka, in the southern part of India. It is an ancient town. It has a well aged look of ancient glory. This glory is reflected in the eyes of everyday people in Hassan. The name 'Hassan' comes from 'Simhasanapura', a city with the throne of the lion. People believe their town was ruled by the great grandson of Mahabharata’s mythical hero, Arjun.<br><br>At the time of Akka’s birth, Hassan was a part of the princely state of Mysore. It was under British colonial rule.<br><br>Life during Akka’s youth was built around agriculture and civic administration. Akka called her father ‘Doddanna’. Doddanna had found employment at the Maharaja’s palace. A stable employment at the palace, was a welcome relief and a source of pride for her family. Doddanna was able to avoid some of the economic hardships of the time. This gave Akka a better start in life than others in her family.<br><br>Akka’s parents wouldn’t travel much. The small parcel of land that they owned, kept them anchored to their community. The cost and risk of travel was only justifiable for marriages or religious occasions.

Caste had a profound influence on Akka’s life. It dictated every aspect of her family's life. Religious practices, diet, social interactions, professions, marriages, and even place of residence was influenced by caste. This provided her with safety and predictability in her early years.<br><br>The narrative of a ‘fate ordained’, was used as a constant reminder to Akka that ‘this was the best it could be for her’. Akka was eventually able to break free of these narratives and chart her own path forward. Her choices forked new branches in the road, upon which I was able to travel with much ease.<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Akka’s life would come to be dominated by two traditions, that were prevalent in her time. <br><br>
The first one was regarding marriage — A girl had her husband selected for her, when she was still a mere child of 8 or 10. Although she wasn’t technically married at this age, her future was tied to her selected groom for all practical purposes. If he were to pass away, and this happened more often than not, she would be condemned to a life of widowhood.
<br><br>
The second one was the prescribed life of a widow — widows were required to live an austere and isolated life, away from society. She was not allowed to remarry. She was required to shave her head. She was to wear a white cotton saree, colored by soaking it in turmeric. She was to eat one meal a day.<br><br>
Widows were often considered a bad omen. Her presence was considered inauspicious at religious and other family celebrations.<br>
</p>Akka's life was to be severely impacted by both these events.

        <br>
Like many cultures of her era, Akka's society had little to no concept of gender equality. While widows were immediately cast to the bottom of societal hierarchy, a widower’s life remained largely the same.<br><br>For a man, there was little or no financial impact. He often remarried and life soon returned to normalcy. I have even heard it said,” Remarriage for a man was a noble act, because it represented his concern for his children who would need a mother.” The contradictions and the hypocrisy of these practices did not escape Akka.<br><br>Akka’s youth was a precarious balance. Nutrition was scarce. Many women and children died in childbirth. Illness and disease took its toll on people. Average life expectancy was between 25 and 35 years. 45-55 years was considered a full life for an adult. Living started early, and did not last long. There was no time to prepare for adulthood. There was no time for childhood.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

Akka was a light skinned child with green eyes. Her given name was “Narsubai”.<br><br>As a child, Hassan was Akka’s whole world. The mud walls of her house, the cow sheds nearby, the smell of spices being ground in the kitchen was an essential part of her daily routine. The creaking of bullock carts as they passed by carrying street vendors selling produce that they had picked from nearby fields earlier that morning, was a familiar and a comforting part of her world. Her day began at dawn, heralded by the ringing of nearby temple bells. She played with dolls made of clay, dressing them up in clothes her mother had stitched.<br><br>Akka’s family belonged to the Brahmin caste, which placed men of her family in a privileged position for education and employment. Within the Brahmin caste, Akka’s family belonged to a sub-sect known as “Deshashtha”. “Deshastha Brahmins” were followers of the Advaita Vedantic philosophy, which taught the principle of duality—that the individual soul 'atman' is distinct from God 'Brahman'. People from her caste were prominent members in society, focused on priesthood and scholarly roles. Doddanna was a beneficiary of this societal structure.

Akka was taught 'Marathi' and 'Kannada' at home. Her parents lived in the region of India known as 'Bombay-Karnataka region'. Akka’s Marathi had a pronounced local accent, which was much different from what is spoken in Bombay.<br><br>Akka’s life was shaped by local customs and beliefs, which she transformed, not into rigid dogma, but into a fearless sense of right and wrong.<br><br>Akka’s father, Mahapathi Srinivas Rao, 'Doddanna', was a forest officer working for the state of Mysore. The name 'Doddanna' implied respect, reserved for a man of stature. Doddanna left an indelible impression on Akka. She would watch him riding off on horseback to survey forests in the area under his jurisdiction. He was a man of authority and purpose.<br><br>Akka's early childhood was fairly typical. She was the first child of her parents and she had their full attention. Akka was born when her mother was 20 years old.<br><br>Early tragedy marked Akka’s life. Her mother died when she was just seven. Akka once told me that she had heard stories of women in nearby homes dying from illness or childbirth, but she didn't truly understand the tragedy until her own mother's death. Akka rarely spoke of her mother, likely because she didn't want to relive the trauma of losing her at such a young age. The pain was simply too deep to articulate.

Akka was not made aware of the cause of her mother’s death. All she knew, was that it was sudden. She remembers relatives and neighbors coming to her house to offer their condolences and remarking how the next phase of her life would be very difficult without a mother.<br><br>This was a frightening period in Akka's life. Her father loved and cared for her, but he was not close to her like her mom used to be. Akka, often sat silent and alone, not knowing or understanding what was to come next. Her mother’s passing left her feeling afraid and uncertain.<br><br>The other implication of this tragedy, although she wasn't aware of it then, was that her childhood days would soon be over. She would have to 'settle down' into a marriage, so she wouldn't be a 'responsibility' to anyone.<br><br>Akka's aunt, Doddanna's sister, 'Jeevathay' had also been married as a child. As fate would have it, her promised husband passed away when she was just ten. In a sad twist of fate, Jeevathay began her life as a widow. It was decided that she would take care of Akka.<br><br>This was Akka first exposure to widowhood. As Jeevathay’s life and challenges unfolded, Akka saw first hand, the inescapable implications of the loss of a husband. It was to be a glimpse into her own future.

I believe this shameful and unjust legacy of Indian culture, with its echoes lingering to this day, deeply influenced Akka's early understanding of life and injustice.<br><br>Akka and Jeevathay started their life together with a bond of mutual support and dependency. The feelings of uncertainty and fear brought them close together.<br><br>Doddanna was often away at work. He provided for his sister and daughter’s well-being. Akka took pride in saying that her father travelled to his work on horse back. Doddanna left a strong impression on her young mind. I have a note from Ratna, Akka’s daughter, who writes of Akka remembering this time. Akka said, “I was raised like a princess.”<br><br>Doddanna arranged Akka’s marriage when she was eight years old. My grandfather was nineteen. His name was Yedatore Srinivas Rao. Akka, had completed her third grade of schooling. She was required to quit school once her marriage was fixed.<br><br>Akka was still grappling with the pain and loneliness of losing her mother just a year before. Now, she would soon have to accept being sent away, facing an unfamiliar world where she would have little or no control. Akka knew nothing of the man she was to marry. She was terrified at the prospect of becoming emotionally and financially dependent on complete strangers, She she lived in fear that childbirth might claim her life or the lives of her future children.<br><br>As with every other aspect of her young life, her hopes and aspirations would be disregarded. After all, she was just a child. Akka was told, “The consequences of not marrying in time is worse.” “You will find a new life in a new home.” “They will provide you with a safe and stable future”. Akka considered these words carefully. There were many compelling reasons why this might not be true. But, she reasoned, that after her mother's passing, she could benefit from the love and support of her husband's family.

Akka entered into this phase of her life, driven by a sense of duty and obedience to the customs of her time. Akka found comfort in the belief that this was in her best interest.<br><br>In my attempt to understand the path confronting Akka's childhood. I have rationalized this to being a choice for survival. The uncertainty surrounding financial resources and health, required her to skip childhood and move into adulthood as soon as possible.<br><br>The adults in Akka's life, genuinely believed these choices were in Akka's best interest, promoting them as the least of all evils. However, society also expected family elders to actively guide their children down this path or else, they would be scorned upon for not shouldering their responsibility.<br><br>Subsequently I got to know Akka, as a strong and independent minded woman. Maybe, as a consequence of being denied many opportunities we now take for granted, Akka chose to break with numerous traditions in her own life. Akka's first two her daughters were married in this traditional format, but my father and his sisters forged their own path forward, with choices they made that they saw to be in their own best interest.<br><br>At 13, Akka left to begin her new life in Mysore. Mysore is roughly 80 miles south east of Hassan. It is an all day train journey. A formal wedding ceremony was planned to see Akka off. Her father had made all the arrangements. A dowry of a small parcel of land, a little money and other minor essentials were given to Akka’s new family. Akka understood that her husbands family were doing her a favor by accepting her into their family. She was to remain grateful to them. Her father sent a cow and a cowherd with her, to ensure that she would be provided for. The wedding festivities made Akka feel that her transition into married life would play out well.

It helped that her husband, my grandfather, himself in his late teens, was a good young man. Ratna, Akka’s daughter writes, “My father was a very affectionate man. He took good care of Akka. “<br><br>The events that followed would have a profound and lasting impact on Akka. She evolved from a traditional conformist into a self-reliant individual. The courage and conviction she had to summon to change direction in a strict and unforgiving society has been a great inspiration to me. In hindsight, the results are clear: my father and his two younger sisters embraced a path of independence and growth, while it took an additional generation for the children of his two older sisters to reach a similar point. The foundation Akka built provided my father with a life of opportunities he would have otherwise not known.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

Akka would need to find hope in her faith, while learning to accept her fate. </p>In 1915, my grandparents' first child was a daughter, Sethubai. As was the custom, her name included the postfix "bai," meaning "lady." My eldest aunt and my father's sister, Sethubai, was a soft-spoken, gentle woman who worked hard for her family and faced life with a quiet smile. I came to know her in her later years, and her sweet demeanor left a lasting impression on me.<br><br>Following Sethubai, another daughter, Sathya, was born, who Akka said was "her father's pet."<br><br>Tragedy, however, would soon strike the family again. Akka lost several of her own children to childbirth and illness. In one particularly horrifying incident, when Akka and my grandfather, lost a son and a daughter on the same day. They were told it was pneumonia. The children had contracted it while they were out playing. With no medical care available, Akka and my grandfather could only watch helplessly as their children slipped away.

Ratna. My aunt writes, "Ny father bundled them both his children in a blanket and carried them on his shoulders to the cremation grounds." As was the custom in her time, women were not allowed to go to the burial grounds. Akka could not say her last goodbyes. Ratna writes, about my grandfather, “He was so sad. When he came back home, he patted Akka and said, ‘Tolerate as best you can. We are helpless.’”<br><br>I still remember Akka closing her eyes in silence, as she spoke to me about the children she lost. She said, "There can't be any erasure of that pain." Akka had 11 children and only 5 grew up to be adults. Akka resolved, " I will have to do my best for the ones I have with me."<br><br>In 1929, came my father, Gopinath Srinivas Rao. Everyone called him "Gopi." As their only son, he would carry on the family name. They doted on him. He, too, was light skinned and had green eyes.<br><br>After him, in 1933 came Ratna, who was dark skinned with black eyes and petite. My grandfather told Akka, "Do not neglect this dark child. She is like me. Give her a good education."<br><br>Finally, in 1936 Manjula was born — a sweet and kind woman who would later become very dear to me.<br><br>Her children were at the center of Akka’s world.

With their meager resources, Akka worked tirelessly to hold the family together. She stitched clothes for her children by hand, often from a single ream of cloth that my grandfather brought home. In her spare time, she learned to knit, embroider, and sketch, and she became an accomplished singer of devotional songs. Despite her third grade education and the immense hardships she faced, Akka found the motivation to pursue her interest in the arts. Akka also made handicrafts with beads and other material. I have with me, a glass bottle into which she had arranged various childhood play things.<br><br>In keeping with the customs of her time, Akka had arranged Sethubai’s marriage in 1926, when she was 11. She was to marry Prahalad Rao. Prahalad Rao was an educated young man and could speak english very well.<br><br>I met him when he was much older. I remember him as an avid fan of cricket. He was a proud man. However, he remained distant from Akka nd her family. Akka and my grandfather were concerned that he would not be affectionate towards their daughter. Their marriage proposal was likely supported by the fact that Prahalad Rao was a close family relative.<br><br>Prahalad Rao worked at a silk factory in Mysore, boiling silk worm cocoons, that would later be weaved into fine silk cloth. The fumes from the boiling pots affected his lungs. He quit work at 40. They had a meager existence past that point.

Ratna writes, “Sethubai eagerly helped others whenever it was needed, believing it was essential to repay the kindness she had received in her own times of need. ”<br><br>Meanwhile, my grandfather had started practicing “Ayurveda”, a form of Indian medicine. Akka helped him grind up the herbs, roots and barks that he would use to make the medicines. During this time, my grandfather acquired the name 'Kaushik'. In a serendipitous coincidence, my wife and I had named our younger son 'Kaushik'—unaware that we were honoring his great-grandfather with the very same name.<br><br>By this time, Akka’s father had married for the third time, and Akka had new stepbrothers. If her stepbrothers misbehaved or got bad grades, her father sent them to Akka, who was tasked with teaching them discipline and the value of hard work. They began calling her Akka, meaning "elder sister," and soon Sethubai and Sathya also started using the name. It has stuck to this day.<br><br>These are the only siblings of Akka I can recall being discussed. In his later years, my father expressed a desire to visit his step-uncles in Hassan. I do not recall him mentioning that the meeting actually occurred.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

My father was 14 years old. By this time my grandfather’s career was progressing well. Ratna writes,” He was very sincere at his job and worked hard in his assignments. He had earned respect within the Mysore Palace office.”<br><br>He was assigned to support a village fair in Nanjangud, a neighboring town. There was to be a celebration in honor of the god 'Shiva'. It was anticipated that there would be a large number of people at the festivities. He was assigned the task of organizing the event.<br><br>Grandfather returned home from Nanjangud with a fever that would not subside. His illness got diagnosed as Cholera. It is not clear if that determination was a best guess or was a considered diagnosis. Ratna writes, “He breathed his last 24 hours later. “ e was 54 years old. In his final hours, my grandfather looked at Akka and said, "My chances of survival are low. I am sorry to be leaving the responsibilities of four kids to you."<br><br>This was a devastating blow to Akka. Akka was only 43. She knew that once she finished grieving her husband's death, her next challenge would be raising the four children at home with her — Sethubai was married and had moved out. The eldest was 18 and the youngest, 9. With my grandpa's death, Akka's world was upended. The stable life she knew vanished, leaving her to face a terrifying new reality. As her livelihood disappeared, the weight of providing food, clothing, and schooling for her children fell squarely on her shoulders. Her three unmarried daughters' futures suddenly looked bleak, their marriage prospects diminished without a male provider. With no marketable skills of her own, these desperate thoughts swirled relentlessly in her mind.

Akka was now forced to make a series of painful and deeply personal changes. As tradition demanded, she would have to shave her head, wear a plain, turmeric-stained saree without an upper garment, and eat only one meal daily. This life meant she would be treated as an undesirable at family gatherings and places of worship, forced to stand as a mere observer at her own children's weddings. The thought of contemplating such a future must have been agonizing.<br><br>Akka's life had been a series of tragedies—the loss of her mother, her children, and now her husband. Each time, she had passively accepted the consequences dictated by society and tradition.<br><br>Yet, this was the beginning of a profound shift in the journey of her life. She made a conscious choice to maintain all traditions and societal impositions on herself, while departing radically from these for her children. She would use the austerity she had imposed on herself as a counter weight, that she would leverage, to grant herself the permission to create a set of opportunities for her children and free them from the burdens that she had had to endure. Her austerity became the anchor of her dignity, a testament to her resilience, in the face of the society she had left behind.<br><br>Her austerity was not a surrender to tradition, but a deliberate act of defiance. She consciously cast aside the 'shields of pretend protections' her society offered, and in their place, forged a strength and discipline that would enable the next generation to make their own free choices.<br><br>Akka adhered to her austere regimen for the rest of her life.<br><br>When I stayed with her during my education in Bangalore, Akka was almost 80. I remember a barber who would come to the house to shave her head on the veranda. Even after all these years, I can still see the profound indignity on her face. It was more than a painful re-living of her husband’s death; it was a repeated and humiliating reminder that she was being penalized for a loss she was innocent of. I remember her telling me, “it is my way of life. I would be uncomfortable any other way”. I remember sitting with her afterward. I know understand why she did this — this must have so strengthened her resolve to encourage her children to break all barriers in their own lives. it was the her way way of bringing forth the rebellion she was suppressing inside of her.

        <br><p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">A tousle of fate and faith</span></p>The year was 1944. Grandfather had just passed away.<br><br>Doddanna, Akka’s father, came to her rescue as much as he could. He helped her sell her house and clear the mortgage loan taken from the palace office. The mortgage amount was Rs 3,850. Doddanna deposited the money left over from the sale, into a co-operative bank account — a sort of credit union, so that Akka could earn a small interest for her living needs. My father was given a hardship allowance of Rs18 from the palace office. Akka had to mange her monthly expenses within this income. There were no electricity bills, as they did not have electricity in the home. They used kerosene lamps for light.<br><br>Akka’s father-in-law did not come forward to assist. In a culture where the son's family carries the paternal last name forward, he did not consider it his responsibility to protect his future generations. I say this because Ratna writes, “He did not consider it his responsibility to care for Akka and her children”. However, he did return the two and a half parcels of land given to him as dowry during Akka's marriage. This was a tremendous help, as the land provided enough food to feed her children.<br><br>The small parcel of land produced enough rice paddy to feed the family of six, with a little left over to barter for other of life’s necessities. The land was tilled by farmers, who after consuming what they needed, would drop off the excess to Akka’s house. The farmers were kind to her, often bringing other items from her land that were out of season. Akka once told me, “They would bring me produce from the farm once a month on a bullock cart. “I was very grateful to them. I would cook a meal for them before they set off on their way back.”<br><br>Prahalad Rao, Sethubai's husband, did not offer any assistance to Akka, during this time of need. My dad tells me there were times, as a teenager, when he would visit Sethubai and be left standing outside the house, shunned.

Doddanna would visit every now and again and bring whatever food items he could from his own field.<br><br>From these sources of monthly income, Akka would clear the house rent and the food needs first, and then pay school fees, books and pencils.<br><br>Akka, who never had an education herself and understood the consequences of that all too well, saw her children's schooling as the primary means to secure their future. She approached the schools head master to forgive the Rs 2 in fees. That request was graciously granted. She was however required to pay Rs 0.25 as a compulsory payment that could not be waived. Akka's neighbors and family often questioned her, saying, "Why spend so much on your daughters' education? They will just get married and leave." But Akka refused to listen, ensuring her remaining children, including Ratna and Manjula, graduated from university.<br><br>Ratna tells me that Akka was a strict disciplinarian when it came to her children’s study. There was to be no cutting of corners. Akka's step brothers were often sent over to study under her supervision.<br><br>Akka's independent spirit was a challenge to the society she lived in. "People saw my challenge of the norms as a threat to the established system that they had prided themselves on," she once told me. In a world where widows were expected to be meek and submissive, she refused to conform.<br><br>She lived by a profound, personal truth. "When things go wrong," she said to me, "we bear the consequences, no matter if it is a result of choices made by us, or a result of following the directives of others." She chose to live on her own terms, doing what was right for her, even if it meant defying the traditions she was raised in.

Much later, in 1975, Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, declared a state of emergency. Within that framework, the law was changed to where ownership of the land went to the farmer tilling the soil. He would no longer be required to share the crop with the land owner. The law was meant to protect the farmer from indentured servitude to the feudal landlords. Akka had no choice. She did not have the resources to challenge the ruling on grounds of hardship. Akka had to cede to the forces of a changing nation.<br><br>The farmers' kindness continued for a while; they would occasionally stop by with fresh produce. Theirs was a relationship built over the ages. They knew the value of the food they brought for Akka. But over time, these gestures gradually petered out. The land, her only inheritance from her grandfather and a source of consistent support for her family for three generations, was now gone. Though it wasn't much by today's measure, she had valued it immensely. She mentioned to me once, "Indira Gandhi kicked poor people like me in the stomach." In her mind, she would now be totally dependent on her children. By this time she did not have a need for it, as her children were settled, but it was a remnant of support that gave her family food during all her time of need.<br><br>Every evening, Akka would gather her children around her and have them recite multiplication tables and poems. She reviewed their calendars and required them to practice their English. She had a limited understanding of content of their lessons, but it was important to her that they studied well.

 Dinner was a simple meal of rice and lentils, served with vegetables from Akka's land that the farmers occasionally brought her. On special occasions she would buy vegetables from the street vendors. The meals ended with rice and buttermilk eaten with a spicy pickle made with lemon. The children sat around her, on the floor of her small kitchen. She made little morsel sized balls of food and placed it in each child’s hand. Ratna writes,” the food always tasted better, when she did this for us.“<br><br>During the vibrant Hindu festival of Dasera, which celebrates the triumph of good over evil, Akka would take out her collection of handmade dolls and arrange them for the neighborhood children. She crafted the dolls from clay, stitched their clothes, and created entire village scenes. These scenes were incredibly detailed, complete with stores selling sweets and grains, cloth merchants, railway stations, schools, and even parks.<br><br>Ratna remembers this time vividly. She wrote, "There was even a fountain in the park. We would light tiny oil lamps for light. Later, your father learned to rig up flashlight bulbs with a battery."<br><br>Akka held a strong belief in the healing power of her faith. As Ratna wrote, "Akka would take her kids to Chamundi hills to thank the residing deity for their health. There were 1,200 steps to climb to the temple. She went there with her kids for five successive Fridays to pray for the family's wellbeing." The passing of her husband and children to illness in the past made her profoundly thankful for the health of her surviving children.

As the children grew older, Doddanna arranged for Akka to move to a new rental house in Mysore. This house, located in a corner of a palace outhouse complex used as an elephant stable, had an outhouse of its own. Akka was able to rent out this outhouse for a recurring income.<br><br>The tenant living in Akka's outhouse had a nephew named Ramchandra Rao. Ramchandra Rao had completed high school and was employed at the “Shimsha Electric Company”. Akka successfully arranged for her daughter Sathya to marry Ramchandra Rao. This was an important milestone for Akka and showed great promise for Sathya.<br><br>Sathya, Akka's second daughter, had finished middle school and wanted to continue her education. She did well in her studies. I remember Sathya as a bright, feisty person, very much like Akka with regard to her dedication to hard work. However Akka, believing it would secure her long-term future, burdened her with the responsibilities of an early marriage. Akka also felt that settling Sathya's marriage would allow the other three children to get a bigger share of her meager resources and attention. Also, This was Akka's responsibility to arrange, as my dad was too young to assist.<br><br>The wedding was celebrated at a neighbor’s, Mr & Mrs Nanjappa’s, home. The Nanjappa's were a kind people. They were well wishers of Akka.<br><br>Sathya went to live with her husband, near the Shimsha hydro electric plant. The plant was built in 1939, in the Shimshapura valley, by the then ruler of Mysore state. Sathya and Ramchandra Rao went on to have 5 children of their own.<br><br>Both Sethubai and Sathya were expecting their first born at the same time. As was the custom, it fell upon Akka to care for, and pay for any expenses, the two mothers might incur during their pregnancy. The children were born healthy and Akka became a grandmother to a boy and a girl. She must have been very happy to receive her first grandchildren.<br><br>To meet her expenses, Akka sold her entire supply of rice paddy from the harvest, leaving no food for the remaining three children for the rest of the year. Once again, her father, Doddanna, came to her rescue, supporting them through that very difficult time.<br><br>It was not expected that Akka's sons-in-law’s would help with their children until they were a couple of months old and returned from their grandmother's house. Even though the sons-in-laws could afford their families' care, societal custom demanded that Akka carry the expense. She would have been considered derelict in her duty had she not done so.<br><br>It seems to me that shortly after Sathya's marriage, Akka fully transitioned to making independent choices for her welfare of her children, irrespective of the dictates of her time. She afforded my father, Ratna, and Manjula a very different set of opportunities.<br><br>I often wonder what she might have achieved if she had been a man in these circumstances. The true measure of her strength, however, lies in the fact that she achieved so much despite a society that placed every possible obstacle in her way.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

        <br><p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Finding a foothold</span></p>Akka's first challenge came after my father graduated from his high school studies. It was common practice to have the first born son take up a job as soon as possible, so that he could take on the responsibilities of running the household. A job would establish the son as the man of the house, providing the family with much-needed stability. This would, in turn, bode well for Ratna and Manjula's futures by making it easier to arrange suitable marriages for both of them.<br><br>But Akka had different plans. She wanted to give my dad the opportunity to go to college. He was a bright student. It would mean more sacrifices for her and her 2 daughters. But, she decided that it was the right thing to do for her son.<br><br>Akka thought that my father should study medicine. She thought that my father might have inherited an interest in medicine from his father, who practiced the Ayurvedic form of medicine when he was alive. There was a medical college in Mysore, and its proximity would have been less disruptive to the family. Still, many considerations remained: Would he get in? How would they afford the fees? What other challenges would he face?<br><br>My father however, wanted to study engineering. After much thought, Akka decided that my father would do well in his field of his choice. Akka had no specific experience with what engineering would provide for her son and her family. Mysore prided itself on engineering accomplishments of the time. However, Akka came to understand that the engineering college in Bangalore was rated higher. My father also wanted to go to Bangalore, as he believed a larger city would offer more opportunities.

Given her circumstances, this was a highly unconventional and risky decision. For most people in her time, entertaining the thought of uprooting the family and finding a way to make a living in a new city—just to support a son's ambition when local options were available—would have made no sense at all. Given how little she had, there was so much to lose. It would have been considered lunacy to jeopardize their future, especially when a stable job in the local civic administration could have set a far more secure course for the family.<br><br>But Akka had made her choice. She was no longer going to follow the well trodden path if her children were to forge a new one. The risk was immeasurable, but she had an unwavering confidence in her son's potential and, more importantly, an unshakeable faith in her own ability to see it through.<br><br>Akka decided she would go to Bangalore with my father to help with the admissions process. Akka was able to get an appointment to meet a Captain Krishnamurthy who was on the selection committee at the BMS College of Engineering in Bangalore. Captain Krishnamurthy’s mother was Akka’s friend and she had kindly agreed to setup the meeting for Akka. Captain Krishnamurthy agreed to help my father navigate the admissions process.<br><br>With the help of the good Captain, my father was able to secure a seat at the engineering college of his choice, based on his high school grades.<br><br>This was a victory for them both. The efforts of Akka's guidance were now bearing fruit, as my father had kept his education front and center against all odds. This was a monumental first break for my father, and in every way, it was Akka who had made it possible.<br><br>At about the same time, the neighbor, Mr & Mrs Nanjappa, who had hosted Sathya’s wedding a few years ago, moved to Bangalore. Akka spoke to the Nanjappas and asked if they might be able to help her son get settled. They offered my father a free room to live in and one free meal a day. It was an act of profound kindness that he never forgot.

Soon after starting school, my father found a job at a tailor's shop close to where he was staying. The tailor offered him a bicycle as payment. This proved to be a significant time-saver, which enabled my father to take on another job tutoring high school students to better cover his expenses.<br><br>Akka began to worry for my father's well-being. Her son was now in an unfamiliar distant city. She disliked the idea of my father having to ask for a free meal every day. What if he went hungry, just to avoid asking for the meal? She convinced herself that Bangalore might offer better opportunities for Ratna and Manjula, even though she knew the move would be disruptive and take time to settle into. She turned to Doddanna to explain situation and get this guidance and support. Doddanna agreed with her plans to support her sons, and offered to provided financial support on a contingency basis should the need arise.<br><br>Despite having his own family to support and with his funds dwindling, Doddanna remained steadfast in his support for Akka, offering her encouragement even when he could no longer provide financial aid. He had always been a source of strength for Akka in her unconventional journey. I have come to believe that Akka and Doddanna were not just father and daughter, but kindred spirits—two determined souls who instinctively understood one another in a world that held them back.<br><br>Doddanna helped Akka move to Bangalore. They moved to a small rental place in Chamarajpet, an old neighborhood in Bangalore city.<br><br>My father, continued with tutoring to pay for his college tuition. Doddanna continued to send some money for expenses, whenever he could. Akka had a few gold coins, gifted by the palace, to my grandfather, as a commendation for jobs well done. Akka, in an act of profound sacrifice, took a loan from the Nanjappas, putting up her precious gold coins as collateral. She had no other choice but to part with them—a piece of her past given up for a future she was building for her children. Today, I have no idea where those coins are. I would have treasured them not just for their value, but as a physical link to her story and a testament to her courage.

Ratna, too, began to work as a tutor. Her earnings helped with household expenses and she was dedicated to paying back her mother's loan. Ratna also worked at a nearby school as a substitute teacher. Eventually she was able to restart her education and completed her studies. Ratna was awarded a Bachelor of science degree from Bangalore university.<br><br>Akka had not just given my father a new beginning; she had willed a world of possibility into existence for him.

He applied for and was selected for a job in the State of Sikkim about 1,500 miles away. He was offered a job as a civil engineer and would be required to do land surveys for the state’s public works department. He was going to be paid Rs 75 per month. The state of Sikkim is located in the eastern Himalayas and borders China (Tibet), Bhutan, Nepal and West Bengal.<br><br>Sikkim was more than just a distant place; it was a world away, a land with a culture so different from Bangalore that it might as well have been a different country. For Akka, it was a plunge into the great unknown. The food, the clothes, the religion, the customs—everything would have been utterly unfamiliar. This was the very embodiment of what she had been warned against her entire life: leaving the familiar confines of her community for foreign lands, a move that would leave him and her completely disconnected.<br><br>Akka had not discouraged my father from applying for the job. She would have preferred if he had picked something closer to home, but she did not make her opinion known. Akka felt that if my father went to Sikkim, he would be a world away. The distance seemed like an unbridgeable chasm. His absence would leave the three women vulnerable, a family without a man to protect them. The idea of moving there herself was inconceivable; the alien culture, food, and climate were too much to undertake. Hassan, Mysore, and Bangalore were all woven from the same familiar fabric, but Sikkim was an entirely foreign land.

Age was also weighing on Akka, and with her daughters still single, the pressure was mounting. Whispers of the community were growing louder, casting judgment on her for failing to secure their marriages.<br><br>For the past five years, Akka, Ratna, and Manjula had poured their heart and soul into building a future for my father and each other in Bangalore. They had made many sacrifices to get this far. But Sikkim was a different world, and Akka felt utterly helpless in the face of such a distance, knowing their carefully built support system could not be extended so far. She had to resolve for herself; would she ask her son to stay for the sake of the family's well-being, or would she let him chart his own solitary path to where it may lead?<br><br>After much thought, Akka came to a realization: the decision had already been made. When she first allowed her son to move to Bangalore, she had committed herself to a path of supporting her children's ambitions, no matter the cost. It was a journey she had to continue. She had resolved to stand by each child and offer her fullest support.<br><br>A priest from the Ramakrishna Ashram had came to visit her. He asked, "Why are you sending your only son so far away? It is not right to leave one's community and culture and go to foreign lands." Akka replied, "If I say no, how can he progress and have a bright future? I do not want my struggle to become his. I will see him off willingly.”<br><br>And, so she did. Akka gave my father her blessing to go to Sikkim and pursue his career.<br><br>It was very difficult for Akka to see my father leave. She never told me this in so many words, but Ratna described her emotions the night before his leaving, "The son she had had raised was moving far away. Was he going to be ok? What if he fell sick? She had worked so hard to keep the family together so they could lean on each other." She would would miss him. She needed to be strong for her daughters too.

I remember a very different situation with my own mother, as I was leaving for the US. It was the usual hot July in Bombay, in 1985. I was to go to Kuwait to get my US visa. If I got the visa, I would go to SUNY Buffalo, NewYork, to study for a masters degree in mechanical engineering. My father had made all the arrangements. He would travel with me to New York city. My father and I were to spend the night at a hotel on park avenue, in New York City. I would proceed on my own to Buffalo. My mother waived to me from the balcony of our house in Bombay. I remember her saying, “Take care. We will visit you in the summer.“ — For Akka and my father, the choice to move out of the house was fraught with real challenges, a significant departure from my and my mother's experience, where it was simply a matter of course.<br><br>Two years into his job at Sikkim, my father responded to an advertisement for job as a Junior Engineer in Air India, Bombay. Air India was the fledgling national air carrier of India. My father considered this a prestigious opportunity. The job offered a significantly higher pay. Culturally he thought that Akka and sisters would find the capital city of Maharashtra appealing. Akka already spoke the language 'Marathi'.<br><br>My father was confident he would have Akka's blessing for this one. One of his cousins, Naga was already in Bombay working as an accountant and Akka knew of his wellbeing. Bombay was culturally and physically closer to Bangalore then Sikhim.

While in Bombay, my father met my mother, Shanta. My mother was from the same caste. Her family had migrated from Tamil Nadu, in 1929. Although they spoke Kannada, their accent was very different and culturally my maternal grand parents felt a stronger affinity to Tamil Nadu than to Karnataka. My mom was born in 1935. She had lived in Bombay all her growing years. She studied at an english convent school, and later went to St. Xavier’s college in the city center. She spoke English well. She was employed at the state owned Life Insurance Corporation of India.<br><br>Akka had already been tested by my father’s unconventional career choices, but his decision to marry presented a new and personal challenge to her traditional beliefs. While my parents had agreed to marry, the marriage could not be formalized without her consent. Akka had deep seated reservations; the woman he had chosen was not from the same community, nor did she share the same cultural background. This was a profoundly unusual situation, a leap into unfamiliar territory with a family she didn't know.<br><br>Yet, Akka had already shown herself to be a woman of extraordinary courage, willing to forge a new path for her children. Having trusted her son's judgment in his professional life, she decided to do so again in this the most personal of matters. Despite her significant concerns, she granted her permission, and gave her blessings to the marriage.

My parents were married in 1959. They had rented a small house in Chembur, a suburb of Bombay.<br><br>Akka continued her life in Bangalore, but she had been unable to arrange marriages for Ratna or Manjula. This wasn't surprising, as these discussions were traditionally initiated and managed by a man, and it was difficult for a widow to break through these societal barriers. It had been much easier for Akka to arrange the marriages of Sethubai and Sathya, as she had the support and influence of Doddanna in their small town of Hassan and Mysore.<br><br>By this time, Doddanna had passed away. The circumstances of his passing are lost to us, but his absence was a profound blow to Akka. She had lost her steadfast anchor—the one person who had been consistently there for her through every trial. After all the years of unwavering support and encouragement he had provided, Akka was now truly on her own.<br><br>Meanwhile, my father, with my mother's tacit agreement, requested Akka and his sisters to join him in Bombay. While this was a common and expected practice—that the eldest son would live with and care for his parents—the negotiations were far from simple. They carried the immense weight of the family’s past moves and the sacrifices that had already been made.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

She had just received an invite from my father to consider a move to Bombay.<br><br>The immense weight Akka had carried for so long began to lift. She felt a deep sense of relief and elation as she saw her son was not only willing, but also able to take on some of the responsibilities for his sisters, validating every sacrifice she had made. It was a confirmation that her solo efforts, spanning over 2 decades, in navigating the perils of marginal living, were beginning to pay off for her son. Her son had been married for three years and she began to sense a degree of confidence in his tone. She felt confident he was going to be able to support his fledgling family and also help stabilize his sisters future. This is what she had worked towards all along. She began to looking forward to seeing his success first hand. My parents were expecting me at this point and she felt that moving to Bombay would give her the added pleasure of seeing a new grandchild up close.<br><br>Staying with one's son was, and is, a deeply ingrained cultural norm in India. It wasn't considered an anomaly. It was the accepted norm, understood and supported by all family members involved. For Akka, the move to Bombay was a way to give Ratna and Manjula a well deserved respite after their immense sacrifices. But she also considered her own future with a clear mind, understanding the unspoken truth that once her daughters were married, there would be no proper place for her in their new households. Her only logical and culturally acceptable path was to live with her son.<br><br>However, for Akka, the decision to uproot her family again, to leave the city that had finally become their home, was not just a matter of logistics. It was a heavy emotional burden. Her move would impose a burden on her son and his daughter-in-law. She had to take this into consideration too.

My father had been a beneficiary of all of Akka's efforts and blessings, and he was eager to do his part to help them settle in Bombay. His career was going well and aside from normal day-to-day life, there really wasn't much reason to not have his mother stay with him. Soon he would be able to rent a larger apartment and things would be easier for everyone. My father felt a sense of urgency in arranging a marriage for his sisters and he thought it would be easier for him to help them settle in Bombay.<br><br>With expressed support from both my parents, Akka began to feel confident that she could make the move a success. She would be an active supporter of my father and mother’s career choices and pitch in to help with their growing family needs as best she could. She had always worked for her family and this would be no different. She fully expected that Ratna and Manjula would soon be settled in their own lives. With a little bit of luck she would be able to partake in the joys of three growing families. She began to look forward to a life of togetherness and stability; a culmination of her solo efforts over the last 2 decades.<br><br>Initially, Ratna was reluctant to leave Bangalore. Her primary concern was not to disrupt her career, which she had worked so hard to build. Yet, I believe the thought behind her decision ran deeper. She was creating a backup plan—a silent promise to her mother that if the challenges of adjusting to a new city proved too great in her aging years, there would be a home and a lifeline to return to.<br><br>My father insisted that Ratna should also move to Bombay. He thought life for her alone in Bangalore would be hard and unnecessarily so. As Ratna writes, “Akka said, 'My son is calling me for a good purpose—to support him and his siblings, and I must do it for that reason. I must not say no. It is the right thing to do.'”<br><br>In early 1962, Akka, Ratna and Manjula moved to Bombay to live with my parent. The were motivated by a sense of duty to each other.

While in Bombay, Ratna secured a job and continued her education in teaching. However, her pay was not sufficient to cover all her expenses, as Bombay was a very expensive city. She had to depend on my father for financial assistance.<br><br>My maternal grandparents lived in Bombay in their own house. My grandmother's name was 'Jayyu'. She came from very humble beginnings in a remote village of a neighboring state of Tamil Nadu. When her sister, who was married to my grandfather at the time, passed away at childbirth, it was decided by the elders in the family, that my grandfather would marry Jayyu. My grandfather 'Mama' moved to Bombay in 1929. Jayyu soon joined him there. He took a job at 'All India Radio' and they had a fairly smooth transition. They had rented a house in Dadar, a suburb of Bombay. Jayyu had 2 daughters, my mother and her younger sister.<br><br>Unlike Akka, Jayyu did not have to face the same grueling struggles. A large part of that was due to the quiet, yet steadfast presence of her husband, Mama. He was a remarkably kind and agreeable man. He was a true pillar of support to her and deferred to Jayyu in all matters of family life. As a hardworking and generous provider, he ensured a life of stability and security that allowed Jayyu to thrive. He even made it possible for her mother to live with them in Bombay. While others saw Mama as a quiet and supportive figure, Jayyu sadly did not share that view. She saw his gentle nature as a weakness, viewing him as meek, indecisive, and ineffective in his role as the head of their family. Mama tolerated Jayyu, because he chose to keep the peace in the family.

While Akka faced life’s uncertainties with courage, Jayyu chose a different path. Deep seated anxieties drove her to build elaborate mechanisms of control, where she became domineering over every aspect of her family's life. Though there was never any real threat to her status, her paranoia made her suspicious of anyone who drew close, lest they disrupt her meticulously curated world.<br><br>This control was her shield against adversity, but it was most fiercely applied to her own daughters. The possibility that they would one day marry and leave the confines of her control was a future she simply had not considered seriously. In her mind, her emotional dominance was an act of deep love, that only she could provide, to protect her daughter's from life's perils.<br><br>Mama's gentle nature rendered him powerless to challenge her methods, and my mother, having grown up under this reign, learned early on that to cross her mother's will was an act of treason. She would never find the strength to do it.<br><br>Akka had accepted my parents invite assuming that they would work out the details. My father motivated by his sense of duty to his mother, assumed that with my mother's help, they would be able to handle Jayyu's need for control and dominance. Little did Akka know that a storm was brewing. One that about to erupt soon after she, Ratna, and Manjula arrived in Bombay. To Jayyu, the arrival of Akka and her family was an unbearable threat to the control she had established over her daughter’s life and future.<br><br>While Jayyu had likely felt a similar unease when my parents decided to marry, she must have believed she could still maintain her power over her son-in-law. But this was different. The collective presence of Akka and her family was an unmitigated invasion, an absolute and total challenge to the world Jayyu had so painstakingly constructed. And for Jayyu, this was utterly unacceptable.

It is striking that despite knowing Jayyu and her family for over three years, my father tragically misjudged the situation and his ability to influence it. In his dedication to providing a home for his wife while also supporting his mother and sisters, he mistakenly looked past what now seems obvious. The threat that Jayyu imagined was not going to be assuaged by appeals to logic or compromise. Hers was an all consuming destructive force.<br><br>By now, Akka had been in Bombay for 18 months. The situation was going from bad to worse with each passing day. All hopes that Akka had for a new life in Bombay, were dashed as the arrangement was fast becoming untenable. Akka had to make a decision. With a heavy heart, Akka, Ratna, and Manjula decided to leave Bombay and head back Bangalore.<br><br>I have often wondered that if they had stuck together for another year or two, would they have been able to make a better life for all in Bombay. Having known Jayyu in my later years, I have since concluded that this would have been a very unlikely outcome. My parents would have had to establish and maintain strict boundaries with Jayyu from day one. They did not do this. Course correcting at later points was never an option.<br><br>Akka left hoping she would find the resolve to resume her struggle and that of her daughters in Bangalore. This was devastating outcome for Akka. She came to the heartbreaking realization that her hopes and aspirations that took her to Bombay were tragically misplaced. That door had shut and there would be no going back.<br><br>Ratna writes (talking about me), “ At the time we left Bombay, you were a year old baby. When we bid goodbye to you at the train station, you lifted your arms, crying, like you wanted to come with us to Bangalore”

She did not have a choice. The biggest challenge as Akka once told me, was "I cannot become a burden to Ratna and Manjula. I have to be careful. They have their own challenges. Society is not supportive of young women making their way forward in life without a man. I have to protect them."<br><br>Ratna was in her thirties by this time. Following recent events in Bombay, Ratna decided to postpone any discussions of marriage for a future time. Ratna's decision was her way of saying that other, more pressing matters would have to take a higher priority. She was now going to take the reins and forge a path toward a stable income, housing, and healthcare. With quiet resolve, she had assumed the full responsibility of getting her younger sister, Manjula, married, putting her own future aside. Ratna felt that her marriage would leave Akka and Manjula alone and unable to fend for themselves. She undertook the colossal sacrifice, born of love for Akka and her sibling. Ratna could only share these plans with Akka in small doses, for she knew that Akka having sacrificed so much, might see this as her own failure.<br><br>The Bombay episode was a jarring setback to Ratna's career. Her confidence, already shaken, was met with a harsh reality: a fledgling economy and an unforgiving society. For a thirty-year-old unmarried woman, the job search was an uphill battle; the prevailing opinion of the time dictated that she should have been looking for a husband, not a job. She would have to make stabilizing their living situation her personal success. Ratna never married.

Ratna applied for a teaching position at a number of local schools and eventually found a temporary role at one where she had taught earlier. Fortunately, a permanent vacancy soon opened up, and she was offered a full-time position.<br><br>After staying in a series of temporary residences, Ratna was able rent a small house on Ratnavilas Road, in a residential suburb of Basavanagudi. This is where Akka and Ratna would stay for the next 20 years. Ratna would now receive a steady salary and could plan a life with Akka. This seemed like a start of something stable and sustainable.<br><br>Akka, began to make Bangalore her home, again. She accepted the terms that life had handed to her. Akka was not a meek person. Her family would not have survived if she was. She had courage and strength. She understood life. She understood struggle. She gave respect and she received it. She managed her challenges with grace and dignity. There were many occasions for despair in her life experiences, but she carried herself well. In a society that was unforgiving and judgmental, she managed to keep her head above negativity. She was older now and she tired easily.<br><br>With her life now settled in Bangalore, Akka began the slow and deliberate process of re-integrating herself into her community. Neighborhood ladies would come to her small home, and she quickly became their confidant, a source of quiet wisdom in the community. She would listen to their concerns and, with an air of patient calm, offer advice born from her own hard-won lessons.<br><br>For Akka, family togetherness was everything, and her philosophy was rooted in a deep seated truths she had learned from a life of sacrifice. As Ratna writes, she would tell them, “You have to learn to get along with family, otherwise you will have to learn to live with loneliness, which is a much steeper price to pay.”<br><br>Her friends found peace in her presence and in her unwavering optimism. As she would tell everyone, “You only find what you are looking for,” and “Look for the good in people, and they will offer that good to you.” Her friends cherished her, telling Ratna, "Ajji (grandmother) tells us old stories that she heard as a child. We love to listen to her.”

When people came to visit, she would offer them coffee. Ratna always left coffee for her in a flask before she left for work. Akka would knit sweaters when Ratna was at work. Ratna would get the knitting started for her, and she wold continue with the pattern. When Ratna returned Akka would ask Ratna to verify that none of the stitches got away. Akka was never one to sit idle. She was always knitting sweaters or making cane hand bags. Ratna has given me memento of Akka’s craftwork that I will treasure forever.<br><br>I remember vividly, during my three years with Akka, the way her composure would give way to righteous anger whenever she witnessed unfair treatment of women or children. She had an unyielding moral compass and would not hesitate to scold the men in our extended family, demanding that they do what was right. It was always a direct expression of the indignation she felt for the powerless.<br><br>She had a unique way of handling these things. She drew a sharp distinction between the person and their behavior, withholding judgment on the individual while fiercely condemning their actions. I have known her fearlessly separate right from wrong. I have seen her consistency of thought. Her word could be trusted. For all the hardships she faced, Akka was easily the strongest person in her clan forged by the struggles she had to overcome.<br><br>Maybe it was her good relationship with her father, who was also a strong man. Maybe it was the responsibility that she had to bear at a very early age, or perhaps it was simply the unyielding will to persevere from which she shaped a life she could not have foreseen.<br><br>Akka’s eyesight was getting worse. Her doctor told her that she needed a cataract operation. Ratna was able to pay for the operation from her savings. Akka reached out to Mr Nanjuppa, who by this time was well connected in the Bangalore community. He agreed to help. He was able to get the operation scheduled at a reputed hospital in Bangalore. Ratna writes, "Akka prayed she would be able to see well again."<br><br>The operation did not go well. Akka's world continued to fade to a blur. Akka was told that a second operation might help, but there would only be a 50% chance that her vision would be restored. Akka decided to not go forward with the second operation.

Her eyes were failing her. On good days she could see silhouettes. She slowly adjusted to life without sight. She lost her sight, not her spirit. Ratna writes, What if I loose my eyes? Ratna and Manjula are my eyes.“ It was a testament to the love she had for her daughters and the courage she had developed within herself.<br><br>In 1977, Akka was able to arrange Manjula''s marriage to Mr. Jamkhandi. My father was also able to help with Manjula’s wedding. Manjula was in her late thirties by then. Manjula was very happy. The couple lived in Mr. Jamkhandi’s house a mile up the road from Ratna's house. With Ratna and Manjula close by, Akka’s life was at its most stable. Akka was able to take a deep breath.<br><br>For Akka, Jamkhandi was a very happy addition to the family. With Akka’s eyesight very weak, Manjula made it her daily routine to visit every morning, keeping her mother company while Ratna was away at work. She would head back to her home by 4:00. Akka was very comforted by Manjula's company.<br><br>Manjula would give Akka, “chapatti and some milk” for lunch. Akka had agreed to having lunch. She was getting weak with age. Jamkhandi also made sure to visit on Thursday evenings and weekends. Akka would eagerly await their visit.

My father had bought Akka a battery operated shortwave radio. It was her lifeline to the outside world. The radio was her constant companion. It was small in size and she carried it around in a little plastic box. Listening to the news on All India Radio became her favorite thing to do, a ritual she performed three times a day. The radio helped her tell time since she couldn’t see the clock. She was also able to cut some vegetables. Manjula let her do this as a way for her to occupy herself during the day.<br><br>Akka would spend her days singing hymns and reciting prayers, a quiet ritual she shared with those who came to visit. After each recitation, she would turn to her guests and offer a blessing, letting them know that she had prayed for their fears to be gone. It was one of the many ways she used her faith to offer comfort and help people find peace. Her favorite hymn was one called, “Sundar Kanda.” This is a verse from the Epic Ramayan.<br><br>She believed that loosing fear was the greatest obstacle to solving any problem. Ratna writes,“Akka always said, If you remove fear, then the right solution presents itself”.<br><br>Akka believed in rituals. After her daily prayers she would perform the sacred ritual of serving holy water. She observed spiritual discipline by fasting for an entire day, twice a month during “Ekadashi” - the eleventh day of the Hindu lunar cycle. She only ate one meal a day. She said,”I need to give my body some rest.“ In the midst of her strength, there was an innocence to her demeanor. It was very touching.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

Bangalore was a growing city, a hub for Engineering schools. My father offered me an option to go to Bangalore, and apply to study at an engineering college there.<br><br>I was overjoyed to be leaving home for the first time. The feeling was a powerful mix of anticipation and a relief that accompanies a much awaited opportunity. By then, Jayyu’s domineering presence had become an oppressive force, and I was in quiet rebellion against her constant dictates. Her interference had also begun to poison relationships within my family, and the atmosphere had become unbearable. The chance to live with Akka and Ratna was more than just a move; it was a desperate plea to break free, a chance to find a new sanctuary away from the conflict.<br><br>I delivered my words to Jayyu with a quiet certainty, informing her of my decision to study in Bangalore and live with Akka and Ratna. I saw her jaw drop, her face a masked in disbelief as she uttered desperate, hollow comments about "being good to me" and the "opportunities I could find in Bombay". I was barely listening.<br><br>That was when I saw the realization dawn in her eyes. I still remember that expression of defeat on her face. I knew, that she knew, that it was over. In that moment, she understood I had already left the confines of her control. The defeat in her expression was absolute. Jayyu had always thought of me as a long term insurance policy, a contingency plan for her old age, that which she believed was firmly within her grasp. With a bitter and jarring certainty, she was about to learn that this was not to be.<br><br>After this moment in time, everything changed dramatically for my parents. My leaving gave my mother the impetus to break free from the Jayyu's bondage. My father's immense patience toward my mother and her family finally began to pay off. He accepted a new job in Kuwait and planned to leave India with my mother and my sisters. I left for Bangalore. We were all moving on.

Amongst other things, two opportunities my father gave me were pivotal to my future. First was his decision to encourage my studies in Bangalore, and later, his immense support for my education in the USA. For these two profound gifts, I will be eternally grateful.<br><br>A major outcome of me studying in Bangalore, was that I was able to stay with Akka.<br><br>Akka was 80 years old. At the time, I was largely unaware of Akka’s life story. I am filled with a deep sense of gratitude and admiration to Akka, Ratna and Manjula. It is a testament to Akka’s profound compassion that after everything she had endured in Bombay, she was so willing to open her home and heart to an 18 year old boy she barely knew. I am very appreciative of the opportunity Akka gave to me. I got to know them all. Jamkhandi became a friend to me.<br><br>I was an uncomplicated kid with a very limited, nascent understanding of the world. I wish I had paid more attention and asked more questions of Akka. The lessons she could have shared were an invaluable guide to life's journey, and my own path would have been so much more productive. It was my first time away from home, and my focus was on discovering the world with my newfound freedom, rather than on the high value people around me.

I stayed in Ratna's rented house on Ratnavilas road, all four years of my Bachelors in mechanical engineering. Her house was at the end of a small street called “Ratnavilas Road”, meaning “the street with Ratna’s house”. This is now hilariously coincidental. This coincidence did not occur to me till after I left the place.<br><br>The house itself was an outhouse. The main house was owned a retired police official. He and his kids and their spouses all lived there. A large house with many people. The owner walked around with a cork hat, like the British used to wear on hunting trips.<br><br>Akka largely kept her distance from that family. She did not think she belonged to their “class”. At this point, my father was well-established in his career. Akka still lived the meager life, as afforded by Ratna’s school teacher salary.<br><br>Akka left my disciplining to my father, which to my blissful joy, he did not exercise very often. At the time, I was thoughtlessly spending money on frivolous things, a luxury my Akka would have never known. I wonder what lessons I might have learned, had I had the wisdom to get to know her better. She had the wisdom to not impose her thoughts on me. Akka had missed all of my childhood. I am not sure what her thoughts were about seeing me all grown up. She expressed her love for me in her own way, without any demands or restrictions.<br><br>Akka wasn't able to see much, but was able to move around the house and do basic chores. She knew where everything was, by memory. When I came back from my school, and she knew, I had not eaten lunch yet, she would warm up the food for me. I was very touched by that act.<br><br>I did not know it at that time, but whatever the limits of my understanding, Akka left a very deep and lasting impression on my mind. I admired her quiet poise, her willingness to engage, her courageous acceptance of life with all its offerings — I just couldn’t express myself in any cohesive manner at the time.<br><br>I had to wait till I was grown up, to catch my understanding up to what she would mean to me.<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>

        <br><p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">A Quiet Departure</span></p>Akka’s health was failing. She was in her early 80’s. Sethubai and Sathya would come to visit her frequently. She had to be pushed in a wheel chair around the house. She could tell when I pushed her wheel chair. She used to tell Ratna, “Papu brought me here to sit in the sun, by the window. “ She called me Papu.<br><br>Ratna had decided that she would build a small house that she could share with Akka. Akka had never lived in a house that she owned, and Ratna wanted her to have that experience. Time was running out. Ratna began construction and engaged a contractor. The contractor was very honest and he worked at great haste to complete the house in time for Akka.<br><br>During the last month of her life in 1983, Akka began to fall ill frequently. She could see nothing - even the silhouettes were gone. She would eat very little. I could see her hand shaking. Ratna had a doctor come in every evening to check on her.<br><br>Dr. Bhatt was a large, quiet spoken, gentle man. He would stop by around 6:30 on his way home and check on her. He charged Ratna Rs 40 for his visit. Sometime he would prescribe some vitamins and other medicines that I would get for her from a nearby drug store.<br><br>Akka had no blood pressure issues, no diabetes, no anemia. Everything looked normal. But she was visibly growing weak as each day passed. She had always been petite. She began to have difficulty eating.<br><br>One evening, Dr. Bhatt came to see Akka. He advised Ratna that Akka needs to be in a hospital as soon as possible.<br><br>1n 1982, there were very few cars in in the part of Bangalore where Akka lived. There was no ambulance service. The Taxi stand was over a mile away at Gandhi Bazar. I went to the taxi stand. They told me to wait for one to come by. Next to the taxi stand was a horse-cart stand.

These horse carts were called 'Jutka' or 'Tonga'. Ratna writes, "You got a jutka as the taxi was not available on that day." My recollection is that I was able to get a taxi.<br><br>Nonetheless, I carried Akka in my arms from her bed to the taxi. I sat with her, holding her, trying to soften the bumps in the road. We reached the hospital in about 20 minutes. The people in the hospital were very caring towards Akka. They would come and check on her every hour. She was coming in and out of consciousness at this time. Despite all their efforts to strengthen her, Akka passed away 13 days later. There was no pain or suffering.<br><br>Akka never saw the house, Ratna was building for her.<br><br>My father’s cousin Naga, with whom my father stayed when he first went to Bombay, performed Akka’s last rites at the crematorium. I was not allowed into the cremation grounds. As per tradition, people with living parents are not allowed to perform the ceremony. My father was working in Kuwait at the time. He had come to see Akka a fortnight earlier and it began to look like she was on the mend. He had to get back to work. It made me sad that he was not able to make it in time for her last rites and I was not allowed to do it. My father rushed back and he was able to perform the 14 days of prayers for Akka’s onward journey.<br><br>For Ratna and Manjula, the loss was immense. For Ratna, Akka had been her only anchor in life. As per my grandpa’s instruction, Akka had taken good care of Ratna. Ratna in turn, was incredibly devoted to Akka. She gave Akka her full attention and care. They truly took care of each other. It was as if this was a relationship that was leftover from a prior life that needed to be completed in this one.

Ratna writes,”Aka never left us. She is always there with me in spirit. Even today, I feel she sleeps with me. Her good wishes and blessings are always with us.“ Ratna kept Akka’a transistor radio at her own bedside. It had stopped working by this time.<br><br>After Akka passed away, I was in my final year of B.S. in engineering. I wanted to experience life in the college dorm. Ratna writes, “I am thankful you chose not to go and stayed with me instead.” In hindsight, i should have never thought to leave.<br><br>During COVID, I had asked Ratna if she would write me a few words about how she remembered Akka and Akka’s life experiences. Ratna wrote me 14 pages of hand written notes. I am ever so grateful to Ratna for doing that. A lot of what I have written here comes from that note. Ratna, in referring to me, asking her to write Akka's memoir, writes, " I thankful to you, Papu, you gave me an opportunity to recall those golden days, full of affection."<br><br>Ratna passed away in June 20th, 2024. She was 91.<br><br>Ratna has left me as a beneficiary on her bank account that contains Rs14Lakhs, approximately $12,000. This was from the savings she was able to put away after caring for Akka and herself. I have tremendous respect and value for this money. I will find a good purpose for it in India.

My children now in the US, are even further away from her way of life. We all welcome advancements in our lives. I am deeply indebted to Akka for having gone through fire. In many ways, Akka's journey made own accomplishments more valuable to me.<br><br>Today, survival is not the issue. The luxuries of modern living, give us the freedom to be individualistic in our choices. This was not always so.<br><br>Today, the support we receive from our community and family is often disregarded. We forget that, without family support, we will experience a severe degradation in our quality of life. We measure success on a personal level. We believe our efforts and merits are the primary determinants of our success. Our desires are a result of ‘ wants’ and not ‘needs’. Before we congratulate ourselves on our successes, we probably ought to pause, to recognize that in every one of our successes, our community and our family has made valuable contributions — just like it was, in Akka's time.<br><br>Our definition of success has changed considerably too. It is almost as if our contentment is a constantly moving target, that keeps us seeking more and more. It draws on much of our energy, but we are often unable to draw a clear line at which point we can say 'enough!'.<br><br>Our approach makes for an incredibly inefficient use of the limited time given to us. As soon as we achieve a degree of contentment, we consider ourselves lazy or complacent, for not reaching for the next 'thing'. We eventually run out of time, chasing something we never accept as sufficient. I believe that Akka was not a participant in such a vicious cycle. She was required to find contentment in what she had. I do not believe she had a choice. Wouldn’t it be simpler if we could be content as an act of choice?

In re-living my conversations with Akka, I realized a fundamental difference in her approach.<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Akka’s objective was to reduce suffering, not maximize happiness. </p>This approach made all the difference to her. She knew when to stop — when she could reduce suffering no more — then, all that was left to do was accept the situation as it was. I find the simplicity of that to be profound. Life in Akka's time was mostly about containing the damage. AKka had to find peace within that which was offered to her.<br><br>It is revealing to contemplate how little is really needed to live a contented life. Nature has what we need and offers it to us for free. We may not always get it when we want it. Or we may not know where or how to find it. But it is always there. The powers that create these forces to sustain life, might have been considered as divinity in Akka’s mind. She prayed to the divine for gifts of survival and she got it. She expressed her gratitude in prayers. She prayed for others wellbeing. Akka knew not to ask for more than her needs. She was aware that many others were seeking the same survival.<br><br>In my present context, it is important for me to remember how I got here. It provides a grounding and a plausible explanation of my current state. It also increases my awareness of the vast number of people who are living in our time, in a condition similar, to how Akka did in her time. It helps me identify with, and appreciate their condition. It helps me appreciate how precarious my own situation is.<br><br>It gives me hope. It gives me examples. It give me humility, knowing that I am the beneficiary of past struggles. The gift given to us, by people before us, is a terrible thing to waste. This has motivated me to write Akka’s story.<br><br>It enforced an understanding of how togetherness matters. When times get tough, some people step up. These are the leaders. For our own sake, they should be heard and respected. They have much to offer. I think of Akka as one such person.

It gives us the knowledge that we can all move forward with hard work, doing the right things, with integrity and compassion. Akka demonstrated that we have these qualities inside us. There is no need to look for external forces to supplement it. There is no need for excess, greed, or taking from others as though life is a zero sum game. It is not.<br><br>Akka's experiences and challenges were very different and significantly more demanding then mine.<br><br>My attempt to capture, her experience, her resolve to do the right thing, her compassion and respect for people, her willingness to accept the norms of the time, and her desire to not impose them on others, has been incredibly revealing to me.<br><br>Most of all I admire her courage to persevere through life's hurdles with courage and integrity.
