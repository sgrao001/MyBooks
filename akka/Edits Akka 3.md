# Edits Akka 3

Here is a list of specific changes to improve the story:
	1.	Break long paragraphs into shorter ones to improve readability. 
	
	2.	Add clear subheadings or chapter divisions for better structure.
	
	3.	Simplify complex sentences; e.g., change “Akka only 43, watched as her world began to crumble” to “At just 43, Akka watched her world crumble.”
	
	4.	Remove repetitive phrases such as “After much thought” repeated twice in succession.
	
	5.	Use more active verbs to replace passive or weak constructions; for example, “was able to protect” could be “protected.”
	
	6.	Correct typos and grammatical errors such as “laying on her bed” should be “lying on her bed.”
	
	7.	Clarify ambiguous terms, for example “pronouced accent” to “pronounced accent.”
	
	8.	Consistently format names and special terms—italics or quotation marks for words like ‘Akka,’ ‘Doddanna,’ and so forth.
	
	9.	Add brief explanations or context for cultural terms such as “kumkum” or “Dasera” for non-Indian readers.
	
	10.	Vary sentence length to improve pacing and emotional impact; shorter sentences can increase tension.
	
	11.	Include more direct dialogue or first-person reflections to bring Akka’s voice and personality forward.
	
	12.	Enhance sensory details in scenes, e.g., describe sounds, smells, or textures to immerse readers.
	
	13.	Avoid overly formal or academic tone—make the prose more conversational and heartfelt where suitable.
	
	14.	Monitor tense consistency; the story sometimes shifts between past and present tense unexpectedly.
	
	15.	Reduce redundancies such as multiple mentions of Akka’s austerity practices in close proximity.
	
	16.	Clarify unclear sentences such as “Akka had to have her head shaved,” by adding emotional or narrative context.
	
	17.	Replace vague phrases like “a large, bare room” with more vivid, descriptive language.
	
	18.	Fix capitalization inconsistencies like “Banglore” to “Bangalore” and “english” to “English.”
	
	19.	Edit for smoother transitions between paragraphs and sections to avoid abrupt topic changes.
	
	20.	Introduce a stronger opening hook to immediately capture readers’ attention.
