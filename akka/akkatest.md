## ‘Akka’ - A quiet hero 
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">The fever came on fast. My grandfather, a man of purpose and authority, returned home from Nanjangud with a heat in his bones that wouldn’t break. At 43, my grandmother, Akka, watched helplessly, as her world began to crumble. This wasn’t just a man dying; it was their livelihood, their children’s future and their place in society, slipping away, hour by agonizing hour. <br><br>The prospect of raising her fledgling family alone, took Akka through a series of decisions, the repercussions of which would resonate three generations down. </p>

This is the story of Akka's journey.

Everybody called her Akka. Akka means ‘older sister’ in Kannada. It is used it as a term of endearment, but also one of respect. Akka, was my father’s mother, my grandmother.



In today's world of "in your face" progress, and "I deserve my wants" bravado, contemplating Akka’s journey helps me separate the grain from the chaff. Her life’s story teaches me that the fight for the greater good, even against all odds, can be won with honesty, dignity, and compassion.

## Legacy of an ancient town
Akka was born in 1901 in Hassan (pronounced "Hah-sun"). There is no official record of her birth. She was most likely born in her maternal grandmother's home. 



Akka’s parents wouldn’t travel much. The small parcel of land that they owned, kept them anchored to their community. The cost and risk of travel was only justifiable for marriages or religious occasions.

Caste had a profound influence on Akka’s life. It dictated every aspect of her family's life. Religious practices, diet, social interactions, professions, marriages, and even place of residence was influenced by caste. This provided her with safety and predictability in her early years. 

The narrative of a ‘fate ordained’, was used as a constant reminder to Akka that ‘this was the best it could be for her’. Akka was eventually able to break free of these narratives and chart her own path forward. Her choices forked new branches in the road, upon which I was able to travel with much ease. 
ere often considered a bad omen. Her presence was considered inauspicious at religious and other family celebrations.<br><br>

Akka's life was to be severely impacted by both these events.

Like many cultures of her era, Akka's society had little to no concept of gender equality. While widows were immediately cast to the bottom of societal hierarchy, a widower’s life remained largely the same.

## A fate ordained

This was the environment into which Akka was born. Akka was a light skinned child with green eyes. Her given name was “Narsubai”. 

As a child, Hassan was Akka’s whole world. The mud walls of her house, the cow sheds nearby, the smell of spices being ground in the kitchen was an essential part of her daily routine. The creaking of bullock carts as they passed by carrying street vendors selling produce that they had picked from nearby fields earlier that morning, was a familiar and a comforting part of her world. Her day began at dawn, heralded by the ringing of nearby temple bells. She played with dolls made of clay, dressing them up in clothes her mother had stitched.

trauma of losing her at such a young age. The pain was simply too deep to articulate.

Akka was not made aware of the cause of her mother’s death. All she knew, was that it was sudden. She remembers relatives and neighbors coming to her house to offer their condolences and remarking how the next phase of her life would be very difficult without a mother. 


This was Akka first exposure to widowhood. As Jeevathay’s life and challenges unfolded, Akka saw first hand, the inescapable implications of the loss of a husband. It was to be a glimpse into her own future.

I believe this shameful and unjust legacy of Indian culture, with its echoes lingering to this day, deeply influenced Akka's early understanding of life and injustice.

 emotionally and financially dependent on complete strangers, She she lived in fear that childbirth might claim her life or the lives of her future children. 

As with every other aspect of her young life, her hopes and aspirations would be disregarded. After all, she was just a child. Akka was told, “The consequences of not marrying in time is worse.” “You will find a new life in a new home.” “They will provide you with a safe and stable future”. Akka considered these words carefully. There were many compelling reasons why this might not be true. But, she reasoned, that after her mother's passing, she could benefit from the love and support of her husband's family.

Akka entered into this phase of her life, driven by a sense of duty and obedience to the customs of her time. Akka found comfort in the belief that this was in her best interest. 

In my attempt to understand the path confronting Akka's childhood. I have rationalized this to being a choice for survival. The uncertainty surrounding financial resources and health, required her to skip childhood and move into adulthood as soon as possible. 

The adults in Akka's life, genuinely believed these choices were in Akka's best interest, promoting them as the least of all evils. However, society also expected family elders to actively guide their children down this path or else, they would be scorned upon for not shouldering their responsibility.
