## About me… 
Hello, 

On most days over the past four decades, I, like many others, offered my perspective and abilities, to create “things” of value — contributions that joined with the work of others, flowing onward like streams converging into rivers and finally reaching the sea. For that, I have been sufficiently compensated. 

As I entered my sixth decade of life, I became keenly aware of how wasteful it would be to halt my journey there. Limiting myself to offering my set pieces of “predefined value” to an external stack of “value widgets” was striping away any meaning I had found for myself, in my work. The value I received from my efforts was becoming transient and short-lived.

I allowed myself the time to pause, reflect, and reorient — to rethink how I should define what I value and which paths I might explore and why. I wished to create new meaningful experiences for myself.

I live in Chicago. I decided to live, walk, think, listen, read and write in the place I had come to love. I was truly astonished by the energy and the resources, the city gave to me, to inspire and motivate myself. I began to take the journey into my self, to explore, and experience the passion and harmony that I knew was buried there.  I concluded that I would do better directing my outward actions from inside. 

As I began to look around, I discovered gems of wisdom that people had graciously left for me  —  in books, conversations, images and artwork   —  in streets, buildings, libraries and museums  — Inspirational gifts, given freely, that which they themselves had acquired through much thought and effort.  It was like having an infinitely large group of well-wishers who were willing to share their journeys and guide me through my own. I wasn’t going it alone. 

I began to make word pictures to visualize what I was beginning to uncover. For the purposes of capturing my learnings, I selected two formats that seemed like they would work well.

Not long ago, people used to send postcards, from their travels, to friends and family. Postcards paired images with a few carefully chosen words, their brevity allowing space for reflection. I found this approach would suit some of my needs.<br><br>
The second format I selected is a short story — drawn from historical events or 
experiences of individuals — to highlight patterns and trends in how life’s movements and interactions have influenced people of the time. </p>
<br>
I am deeply appreciative of my journey and the support of my family that has brought me to this point.
