## Preface
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">“I am the awareness of the sum total of the contents of my energy halo, including, the way it is organized, the way it is maintained, and the way it conducts energy exchanges with nature in all its forms.<br><br>

I intend to harvest the energy of my city-verse, to use it for meaning, and then hand it back.”

## Introduction
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text"></span></p>
It has been on a long journey, reading, listening, thinking, internalizing, and working to put my understanding into practice. It has been an exciting process, involving literally ‘miles and miles’ of walking. It has changed the way I look at myself and things around me.

So many accomplished people with such diverse experiences have so much to say. Translating this to my context has enriched me immensely.

Along the way, I developed an awareness of things that impact my well-being, things that I am good at, things that energize me, and things that will continue to build meaning for me, over time.

In the following pages, I have written down my learnings, so I can refer to and refine, as new experiences occur.

As you read this, you might extract parts that are meaningful in your own journeys and experiences. I would love to see this being useful to you in some way.

Enjoy!!!

## Initial Thoughts
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Initial Thoughts</span></p>

These notes make no claim as to truth or knowledge. They are to be thought of assteppingstones, each one to be picked up, inspected, chiseled, polished, and placed back,only to be re-done, as new understandings come to light. Their sole purpose is to spur curiosity, and in that role, they are intended to be provocative and incomplete.

Truth might well be the realization that “I” refers to the awareness of the contents of an energy halo unique to all beings. This halo created at birth by biological encoding, is sustained by a continuum of observations, experiences, emotions and actions, and relationships to energy flows that are integral to that being. The evolving nature of this understanding makes the journey into the self a lifelong pursuit.

The reward, also perpetual, is continuous passionate living and harmonious coexistence. Passionate living is continuing forays into the outer edges of cognitive capacity. Harmonious co-existence is effortless energy exchanges, with fellow beings and nature in all its forms.

The journey into the self is a solo journey. Solitude is a pre-condition to meaningful experiences.

## The Toolbox
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">The Toolbox</span></p>
Tools for the journey: 
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Conviction: A resolve to be true to self, with all reflections, always. <br>
Commitment: A complete ownership of all contents of the halo, as it was, as it is, and as it will be.<br>
Acceptance:  An acceptance that all is as it should be, no matter what!!. <br>
The three wise men of mind organs: Consciousness, Intuition, and Conscience. <br>
Will to Act: The use of energy to direct action and to release residual footprints left in the halo.
</p>
Energy is not to be stored in the halo, only consumed, or discarded. This frees up space for continued and effortless new energy exchanges.

Whilst these tools exist in sufficient measure in all beings, they are to be applied with deliberateness. These tools draw energy from the halo and replenishment comes from the rewards of passionate living and harmonious coexistence.

## Theater of the mind
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Theater of the mind</span></p>

About 70,000 years ago, the cognitive revolution began in man, with the evolution of the organs of the mind.

In addition to the three wise men , mind organs such as, an imaginer of the unknown, an interpreter of reality, an understander of time, a creator of thoughts, a builder of patterns, an observer of images, a speaker of languages, a processor of energy into emotions, a believer of myths, a storer of memories, a counter of things, and a “Will’er” of timely actions, and more, came into being.

Unlike the physical organs of the body, mind organs possess capabilities that are unique to each being. This makes them difficult to label and understand.

Without direction, these organs constantly raise alarms (to protect), simultaneously engaging into every external energy spike to seek refuge of one sort or another, exhausting energy reserves in the halo, and leaving behind considerable footprints.

Harness the actors in the theater of the mind, to curate energy flows and residual footprints in the halo, in support of the journey into the self. Focus them inward. When they are alarmed, say,” Thank you, but I am ok! The three wise men have this in control.”

![[000dLanguage.jpeg]]
## Language of the mind
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Language of the mind</span></p>

The faculty of language is the limiting factor in thought and understanding. Language, as a communication mode between mind organs, is analogous to the neurological signaling between the body organs. While most body functions are involuntary, the three wise men control the functions of the mind.

The three wise men determine what energy is attracted into the halo, what flows through, what is consumed, and how residual footprints are released. This is done by instructing the “Will” to trigger lower mind organs to work on the energy content of the halo.

The three wise men also receive messages from the mind organs, which they interpret and “Will” action, to ensure focus is maintained on doing the “right” thing, in the “best” way, and with “compassion”. They also “will”, actions through a neurological interface to create “physical body language” to broadcast visible energies to the outside world.

The three wise men use language to keep all the mind organs aligned. 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">What is said to the self has consequences. Self-love and soothing language lubricate the mind organs for frictionless functioning.</p>

<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000eFeelings.jpeg]]
## Feelings in the mind
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Feelings in the mind</span></p>

The three wise men choose

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
which energy flows through the halo, what to harness, and what is “Will’ed” to be provisioned to the mind organs. </p>
Mind organs transform this energy into emotions. Emotions are seemingly coherent, but often inaccurate interpretations of reality.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
The three wise men, interpret, validate and assemble emotions into feelings. 
Feelings are used to direct the “Will” to action. 
</p>

The three wise men must continually ensure that feelings and actions support open,  passionate and harmonious living.

Energy harnessed during energy spikes and feelings inappropriately actioned, or ignored, result in wasteful energy consumption and higher residual footprints. Footprints must be released.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">Residual footprints are considered released when their associated feelings are rendered irrelevant.</p>

Feelings represent universality and equality in all beings. Feelings make actions purposeful and consciousness meaningful.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000fInterpretations.jpeg]]
## Interpretations in the mind
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Interpretations in the mind</span></p>

The stories of past energy consumptions from the halo, are stored as experiences in the memory banks of the three wise men.

Associated interpretations (two very different types - (type I and type II) and actions, are stored alongside.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Type I interpretations are automatic, intuitive, fast, reasoned by association, loosely pattern matched, emotional conclusions and necessary for survival. They have applicability in high noise / high bias scenarios. They seem coherent and suppress ambiguity.
<br><br>
Type II interpretations are deliberate, effortful, logical, and verifiable analysis, necessary for knowledge and purposeful living. They require the problem and constraints to be well defined with a timely feedback loop. They find use in rule based deterministic environments.
</p>

The three wise men reference experiences in their memory banks to guide in assembling emotions into feelings and developing directives for “Will’ed” actions,

<p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">They must aim for descriptive adequacy&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="highlight-text">NOT</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;explanatory adequacy in storing experiences.</p>

![[000gPassionateLiving.jpeg]]
## Passionate living
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Passionate living</span></p>

Passionate living is an outcome of repetitive choices, made by the three wise men, regarding,

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
What outside energy is attracted into the halo, What is allowed to pass through, What is consumed and What is the desired outcome from that consumption. </p>

It is the consequence of a conscious journey into the self.

Genetic endowments create pre-dispositions in all beings.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Passionate living is the spending of energy in the pursuit of actions aligned with these pre-dispositions. 
</p>

Nurture, what nature has given. Timely outcomes, larger rewards, and smaller residual footprints are an indicator of passionate choices. Often, this is a result of referencing type II interpretations. Energy obtained from outcomes becomes consistently greater than consumption. This pattern of passionate living is visible and regenerative. Energy obtained from outcomes becomes consistently greater than consumption. This pattern of passionate living is visible and regenerative.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Passionate living involves repeated journeys from the knowledge core to the outer edges of cognitive capacity along the radius of genetically endowed pre-dispositions. It is the relentless pursuit of conditioned ignorance.
</p>

Passionate living expands the halo and smoothens energy flows in it. The desire for passionate living rests on a foundation of curiosity.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000hHarmoniousLiving.jpeg]]
## Harmonious living
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Harmonious living</span></p>

Harmonious living is a result of effortless exchanges of energy, a consequence of smooth energy flows in and out of the halo. Smooth flow is a function of, 

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
The turbulence of outside energy, The size of the halo, The amount and intensity of the energy attracted into it, The number of residual footprints, and the effort to release them. </p>
The value of smooth flow is to allow for timely energy spend on,

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Wide observation scans, Selective consumption, Focused action, Receipt of timely feedback, A continuous need to release residual energy footprints and Lessen the reliance on dis-passionate, impromptu and inconsequential living.</p>
Everything and everyone in nature is transmitting energy back and forth. The three wise men must

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Set the pace of engagement, and Set the pace of the release of footprints. <br>
Retain focus on doing the “right” thing, in the “best” way, and with “compassion”. </p>

The primary goal of harmonious living is

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Energy conservation, Smooth flow in the halo, and Lowering the need for corrective action (release of footprints in the halo).</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000iReleaseFootprints.jpeg]]
## Release residual footprints
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Release residual footprints</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Consumptions of energy from the halo, irrespective of outcomes, will leave footprints.
</p>

To allow for continuous and smooth energy flow through the halo, they must be released. The three wise men, as custodians of the halo, must take ownership of its contents and must continually “Will” action to release residual energy footprints within it.

The three wise men must repeatedly walk around each residual footprint. This inspection changes their perspective. It allows for multiple points of view to assess impact in a micro sense.  They must also change their frames of reference by zooming in and out to assess relevance to the bigger picture, a macro sense. 

The outcome of these zoom & pan journey’s must be

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
A “Will’ed” re-orientation of emotions, feelings, and re-setting of mind organs, so that emotions and feelings lose their relevance in any current or future context, thereby considering them to be released. 
</p>

A quantified understanding of effort to release footprints must be stored in memory banks for future reference.

This is a vital health task of clearing and cleansing of the halo

![[000jBeTheEyeInTheSky.jpeg]]
## Being Open
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Being Open</span></p>

Openness requires observing energy flows and footprints within the halo, and the functioning of mind organs.

Being open is a key responsibility of the 3 wise men.

Dominion over the halo is liberation. Dominion over the halo and the outside energy flows, and their interactions, is enlightenment. Maintaining continuous enlightenment is being open. 

Openness is oversight over a continuum of mind functions. From the inside to the outside, they are thoughts – emotions – feelings – interpretations and reality.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">When open, observations occur without purpose, without anticipation and without judgment. Open implies that there is awareness of passionate and harmonious living. Open reaffirms the role of “I” as the guest of honor in the theater of the mind. Open reaffirms the ability to focus the actors inward. Open is an outcome of consciousness. Open allows the three wise men to curate quality into their memory banks and the halo. Open manages energy deficits, where spend is maintained below received. Open ensures smoothness of flow as its highest priority.</p>

![[000kEnergyOftheUniverse.jpeg]]
## Connect with the universe
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Connect with the universe</span></p>

All beings, living and inanimate, contribute to the energy flow in the universe. All beings must harness this energy to steer into passionate and harmonious living.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
The universe is a limitless and free energy resource.  Every human made object was built with human energy investments and continues to be maintained by it. Every other object in nature evolved with the application of forces over time and continues to be sustained by it. All beings are bundles of energy in motion. Energy exchanges occur at every instant in time, in massive doses. History has locked energy into objects, waiting to be released. Openness allows the halo to attract and be receptive to new energy flows. 
</p>

Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It may only be stored for short periods and footprints must be released. Footprints stored for longer durations take up space, that the halo would have used for new exchanges.

Harmonious co-existence with the universe, (effortless energy exchanges), feeds the energy needs for passionate living. The meaning of life is a function of the energy connections the three wise men make in the halo’s neighborhood.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000lPillarConscious.jpeg]]
## Consciousness
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Consciousness</span></p>

*Consciousness is the first of the three wise men. Consciousness has awareness of the halo and outside energy flows.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Consciousness directs the “Will” to ensure functioning of mind organs and timely release of residual footprints. Consciousness of the outside flow attracts external energy which supports passionate and harmonious living.<br>
<br>
Consciousness requires suspension of all interpretations until descriptive captures from multiple perspectives are stored in the memory banks as experiences. <br>
<br>
Consciousness appends the present context - descriptive captures to the memory bank for future reference.<br>
<br>

The descriptive captures describe three contexts</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
The context outside the halo<br>
The context held within the mind organs<br>
The context within which feelings make sense.<br>
</p>

Consciousness is the experience of awareness without content (a probability space ) and have content arise as a consequence of it. Consciousness is that in which all experience appears, with which all experience is known and out of which all experience is made

Experience is all sensation (feelings of the body - sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) and the emotions (feelings of the mind) presented by the mind organs.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000mPillarIntuition.jpeg]]
## Intuition
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Intuition</span></p>

Intuition is the second of the three wise men.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Intuition appends an interpretation of reality, and the prediction of a likely outcome, to the descriptive content that consciousness stores in the memory banks. <br>
<br>
Intuition makes judgments as to which type of interpretations are applicable in the present context and employs it to assemble emotions into feelings which direct action.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Type I interpretations, matches patterns and generates fast approximations as confident guidance. While useful as a survival mechanism in noisy, non-deterministic, and threatening environments (external energy spikes), it is best to wait till the spikes subside before exploring applicability of “Will’ed” actions. <br>
<br>
TypeII interpretations result from previously validated cause-effect relationships in deterministic environments. They result in lower footprints than those “Will’ed” by type I.
</p>

Subsequently, intuition updates the memory banks with the energy consumed to release footprints left behind in the halo by these actions.

We don’t see the world as it is, we see it in a way to survive it. Evolution did not revolve mind organs to require determination of truth. The probability space of actions would be too large causing analysis paralysis resulting in high risk of death. Even though the threat to survival is removed the mind organs still function in the interpretive fog v/s the establishment of the terms of reality. This is similar to the craving for fats and sugar, even though there is no longer a fear of starvation
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000nPillarConscience.jpeg]]
## Conscience
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Conscience</span></p>

Conscience is the third of the three wise men.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Conscience appends to the memory bank, a “judgement” of residual footprints that a particular “Will’ed” action would leave in others. This judgement is aided by consciousness and intuition’s prediction of their reaction. This judgement applies to all things in nature, living or inanimate.
</p>

Conscience supports harmonious living by promoting “Will’ed” actions that would minimize residual footprints in others.

Considerations of conscience must only apply, after energy residuals in self are minimized. Priority to self must be enforced. Ignoring residuals in self is sacrifice and is unsustainable in time.

Consciousness forms the basis for doing the right thing.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000oThreeWiseMen.jpeg]]
## What must be done
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">What must be done</span></p>

DO THE RIGHT THING.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
The three wise men must “Will” action to regulate the half-life of the manic highs and depressing lows. Under regulation will result in wild peak-trough swings and consequential dysfunction. Over regulation will flat-line into monotonic meaninglessness. <br>
<br>
It is about the energy trade-offs, to pre-regulate, as opposed to the release of residual energy footprints after the fact.
</p>

DO THE BEST THAT CAN BE DONE.  Use the three wise men to,

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
oversee the regulating mechanism by being open. Maintain equilibrium in the inherent bi-polar bookends present in all beings.
</p>

DO IT WITH COMPASSION.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Use the three wise men to guide minimizing footprints in self. <br>
<br>
Assist others to support their needs, but only to the extent that understood and accepted amounts of energy are consumed from the halo. Use conscience to guide minimizing footprints in others. Always, compassion (to self, first and then, to others).
</p>

Compassion is about energy conservation.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000pProtectYourself.jpeg]]
## Practice with meditation
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Practice with meditation</span></p>

Knowing what to do, and summoning the “Will” to do it, goes 2/3rd of the way. Doing it - is the final third.

The purpose of meditation is to practice being persistently open. This requires discipline.  Discipline, exercises and strengthens the three wise men.

Discipline is accomplished through frequent meditation, which reinforces desired behaviors to the three wise men.  It keeps “openness” front and center, making it a persistent theme. From that, comes the ability to do the “right” thing, in the “best” way, with “compassion” and with ease.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000qdiest.jpeg]]
## Rewards of the universe
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Rewards of the universe</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
When one’s actions leave behind footprints, energy which would otherwise be available to all, is spent on its release. 
</p>

This is wasteful. This lowers the overall availability of usable energy flows in the universe. This weakens the self and the universe around it.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Conversely, compassionate living increases the availability of free usable energy. This ensures sustenance and increases growth in nature in all its forms, creating a regenerative energy cycle in the universe.
</p>

Compassion ensures the supply of energy for harmonious living that funds the perpetual rewards of receiving energy in a measure greater than its expense.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> ~***~ </p>
<div style="break-after: page;"></div><br>
![[000rMeetingOfTheMinds.jpeg]]
## Majlis in the mind
<p style="color: #f09e5a;"><span class="highlight-text">Majlis in the mind</span></p>

As an integral part of meditation, the three wise men, regularly deliberate on the feelings and associated actions stored in their memory banks.

<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.4; font-style: italic;">
Did they support passionate and harmonious living?<br>
Is the descriptive and interpretive content of the memory banks aligned with reality as experienced after the fact?<br>
Are the lower mind organs focused on the self? <br>
Are the emotions they surface appropriate?<br>
Are the feelings and the actions they motivate aligned to being open?<br>
Are footprints released in time? <br>
Is the smoothness of flow maintained in the halo? <br>
Do energy tradeoffs limit the half-life of peak-trough swings? <br>
Is being compassionate a high enough priority?</p>

The majlis is a sitting room in the house of meditation, where the three wise men reflect on “I”, the separate self, express self-love and gratitude, make choices, re-affirm their roles and give meaning to the words: Liberation, Enlightenment and being Open,
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: bold;"> I must remember, I am the guest of honor in the majlis. </p><br><br>
